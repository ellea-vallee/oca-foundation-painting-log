The aim of this exercise was to make a series of quick studies in my sketchbook using watercolour paint in preparation for a still life painting. I was to spend no more than 15 minutes on each study and produce at least eight different studies, working from life with one or two objects, fruits, or a bright scarf and a bag.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The intention was to:

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- focus on the relationship between colours,
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- keep the colours vibrant, not muddled,
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- keep the studies fresh and simple and avoid overworking

## First study: simple objects but complex shapes!

_First sketch: toy beach chair and jewelry box_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For my first attempt at completing this exercise, I looked for interesting objects to paint and settled on a toy beach chair and a jewelry box. I didn't want to do "just a pepper" or "just an apple" but in the end, I ended up with a challenge that was beyond what I was supposed to do (focussing on the relationship between colours) and got instead caught in drawing shapes and shadows. When it came to using the water colours, I tried to stick to primary colours from my Schmincke's Horadam aquarelle testing set (Pure yellow, Ultramarine, Perylene dark read, Burnt umber and Yellow raw ochre).

_Faux beach chair (Sketchbook study)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The result was OK but it was very difficult to create contrast with the watercolor while "keeping it fresh and not overworked." The beach chair is a simple object but a very complex shape, creating many different and intricate shadows.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

It sounds obvious in hindsight but after a while (and much more than 15 minutes!), I felt this was too challenging for the purpose of the exercise. I decided to move on and complete the drawing with a black outline using my ink pen. In the end I felt it looked more like an illustration than a painting, although I still have to figure out what the difference is for myself...

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Still I feel somewhat happy with the end result given how challenged I felt to complete it. I enjoyed little details like getting some of the shadows right on the wood. I struggled to keep it within the boundaries of what I saw (especially the jewelry box) and ended up approximating but I enjoy the process more. I felt the shadows were not dark enough, their colours were not uniform and all over the place. Still in the end, the main learning from this study was to use simple objects to begin with!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"className":"wp-block-heading"} -->
## Second study: a simpler set-up with loose strokes
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the second study, I decided to stick to a more "classical" set-up. I found a metal jar in a charity shop and bought some lemons. I tried to keep it "fresh" and bold without using a sketch first. This time, I struggled to control my paint strokes. Once again, I found the result pleasing and I definitely enjoyed the more loose process in this drawing. Still, I am not sure I succeeded in reaching the aim of the exercise, namely to explore different combinations of colours to understand colour relationships in preparation for a still life painting. It was too much to think about values and shadows, while also trying to control the unruly watercolours while _also_ thinking about colour relationships!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In hindsight, looking at the colours now, I feel the blue and the greys worked well together but the light yellow of the lemon is perhaps too bright?

_Still life sketch (the angle of the live view was slightly different from the photo)_
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- /wp:gallery --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For my third study, I set up the lemon and the pitcher against a pink background and used a spotlight to light it. I took my time to sketch the drawing. I was wearing my varifocals, and sitting on the couch with my sketchbook on the coffee table. In the end by drawing was squished down compared to the original! Later on, I came across the concept of the "error of parallax" which occurs when one looks at a sheet of paper at an acute angle and thought I need to use a table easel and teach myself to draw vertically rather than on a flat surface if I want to draw and paint from life.

_Pitcher and lemon II (sketchbook study)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The final study was overworked and not so "fresh" as I got carried away trying to paint the shadows on the pitcher and the lemon. I do love creating form from the shadows!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The Lemon looked a bit muddied although I also liked the nice texture it created. But then, looking at it again, it feels I didn't have enough contrast between the light areas and the dark areas. It's evident if you look at the photograph of the set-up. My main issue is to control the darkness with the watercolours. This being said, I like the grainy aesthetics.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the end, I didn't mind so much that the shapes were slightly distorted. On the contrary, it made it more interesting to look at. I did enjoy making this "study" even though I realise it was, again, departing from the purpose of exploring colour relationships.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"className":"wp-block-heading"} -->
## Fourth study: Changing the subject
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

One challenge I have is to get myself to do and redo the same thing over and over. It feels painfully boring to do the same thing again! Already, after two attempts with the Pitcher and the lemon I felt I needed to change the scenery for the next study. This time I aimed to bring more colours together: blue, yellow, orange (I even bought a Sharon fruit!), brown and pink. I set up a tabletop easel so that my sketchbook better angled and aimed to draw the still life holding my pencil like a brush.

<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- /wp:gallery --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I tried to limit myself in time to 15 minutes. The bell rang but I wanted to continue so at least I know it took me longer than 15 minutes. I tried to focus on keeping the colours vibrant this time and only go over to add depth using the same colour but with more pigment. I managed to get an interesting effect with the dark values which I think was also because I had put my sketchbook on the easel and the pigment flowed downward; a happy accident!

_Fruit bowl I (sketchbook study)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I feel the colours are possibly working best here, although there is a feeling still that the bowl is floating rather than solidly anchored on the table. I enjoy the final result, even if it's just a study. I don't mind the imperfections, maybe I should. I don't know! One thing I noticed is that perhaps the back line is too aligned with the top of the bowl. I think it might work better if I had it slightly lower. The bowl is also perhaps too much in the middle, and the shadow too round to appear to be on the table. I might try to elevate the set-up next and place the bowl against a white background to see if it makes a difference. But overall, this is perhaps my best colour study, also because I didn't use the ultramarine. Unfortunately, I didn't record the colour I used so I don't remember how I got that lovely turquoise hue.

## Fifth study: using white background

_Fruit bowl II pencil sketch (sketchbook study)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this study I simplified the background, hanging a white piece of paper against the heater and another one laying flat on a coffee table. It made it easier to see the shadows and the horizontal line.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I drew again using my pencil like a brush. I suppose the sketch was not adequate but I didn't know how else to approach it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I then applied the watercolour on broad areas and aiming to add layers to add depth. In the end the result was again grainy and overworked. I found it difficult to know what I was aiming for. What should I aim to improve? I tried

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {"id":845,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"media"} -->

_Fruit bowl II (sketchbook study)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Compared to the previous study, I felt this one was too overworked and grainy. This being said, however, I thought the Sharon fruit was not too badly rendered with a good amount of contrast to make it "pop out". I didn't manage to render the shape of the front lemon through the shadows, however. Also while the cast shadow was OK, I didn't manage to render the feel of weight. Looking at it now I am thinking I should have added a darker shade at the bottom of the bowl. But adding more doesn't result in the intended effect, sometimes the brush has too much water and it lifts rather than darkens and then I end up with a grainy look. Perhaps it's the watercolour medium which doesn't agree with me!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"className":"wp-block-heading"} -->
## Sixth study: regressing...?
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the sixth study, I tried to improve the form of the lemons. This is probably the study that got me most frustrated! I layered three colours on the background. First, pink. It didn't work so well. Next green, which also was rather disastrous! Finally a mix of black and blue. The water leaked down and even though I waited for the layers to dry, it still showed through. I think the grey blue still is clashing with the pink, which in turns doesn't work with the blue tones of the bowl.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I had also changed brush and started to use a round "aquafine" which holds less water and can hold more pigments in. I also used a large palette of Winston watercolour pans with (too) many colour hues as I thought perhaps I was too restricted with one set of yellow, red, and blue. Although rather than help, this led me to create something rather messy. I tried not to give up too early and came back to it later to try and make it better. I can still see many issues. The most annoying is perhaps the shadow underneath the Sharon fruit which is still too light.

_Fruit bowl III (sketchbook study)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:heading {"className":"wp-block-heading"} -->
## Seventh study: uncertainty galore
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I was reflecting on the "accidentally Wes Anderson" photographs, and, for the penultimate study, aimed at a different composition with a lemon on each side. I sketched the shapes a little more loosely, still on my table easel on a vertical angle.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I retained the different hues of yellow for the lemons because even if I was not able to match the hues of the shadows, it still creates a pleasing form.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then I tried to mix grey from the colour of the shapes. Blueish for the bowl and yellowish for the lemons. I also aimed to anchor the still life by using darker shadows underneath the bowl and lemons.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I am a little happier with this study. It's a bit stylised but I don't mind so much. It still show overworked messy marks and I don't quite like the green background. I don't think it works well with the blue bowl. Perhaps I should have opted for a light blue instead. But at least I got the dark shadows although the one below the right lemon lacks pigmentation.

_Fruit bowl study IV (sketchbook study)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:heading {"className":"wp-block-heading"} -->
## Eighth study: going back
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I was thinking of one piece of feedback I received for Part 1 which resonated, namely my lack of persistence and the advice that I shouldn't give up too early when I know something is not working and instead go back and reflect on how to make it work (better). It's tricky to find the "sweet spot" between not "overworking" a piece and not giving up too quickly.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Still... after I had completed the Lemon and pitcher I (which I did very loosely without a pencil sketch), I had sketched the pitcher with pencil and filled the background with a blue wash. I got frustrated at that point because I ended up with lots of "cauliflowers" and I had given up without adding any more colours on the lemon or the pitcher. So for the last study I returned to the sketch and added some light colour and shading. It is not a finished piece and I am not sure the bright blue works with the yellow lemon. Nothing spectacular but at least I didn't give up entirely.

# Final thoughts 
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- Focussing on the relationship between colours was more challenging than I would have anticipated but perhaps because I was challenged by the medium as well. There is so much to interact with when using watercolor (water, pigments, brush, paper) and it is very unpredictable. I found it challenging to forget about everything except the relationship between colours!
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- A note to self, however, is to be more diligent when I paint so that I remember which colour mixes I used so I can reproduce happy accidents!
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- It was also hard to keep the colour vibrant. I somehow found it easier to work on [Exercise 8](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/category/coursework/exercise-8-expressive-marks/) using acrylic rather than with watercolor where vibrancy was harder to achieve even from raw colours.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- On reflection, perhaps the best study for this exercise was the "Lemon and pitcher I" where I didn't use a sketch but simply looked at the objects and loosely blocked out shapes and shadow.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I feel I'm lacking skills and technique but I don't know which technique I should practice more. I certainly did not enjoy using watercolors for studies, I think it was too challenging to think about values as well as hues and pigmentation! When I follow tutorials I can draw but somehow it's not translating to what I do when I am "on my own". Online tutorials are also from photos so perhaps I was challenged here because I was drawing from life and this is what I should aim to practice more.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I do not find hyperrealistic drawings very appealing. I admire the craftsmanship and I know I can produce detailed drawings but I find them a bit soulless. Finding the right balance is my challenge however! I'm reading Nietzsche's Birth of a tragedy and the ideas resonates with that feeling. I'm searching for the sweet spot beyond the plastic and "Apollonian" beauty and the more earthy, looser "Dyonisian" aesthetic. This is probably an oversimplification but that's where I am at for the time being! Part of me thinks I should first improve my mastery of drawing and painting skills before I can be free; the other part thinks what is the point of learning if ultimately, I want to unlearn (like Picasso who famously said it took him four years to paint like Raphael and a lifetime to paint like a child!). Can one travel the other way, from a raw connection with the embodied experience of seeing and transcribing, towards a more refined, skillful rendering?
