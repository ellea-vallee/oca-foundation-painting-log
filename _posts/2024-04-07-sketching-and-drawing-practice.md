I registered for an online sketching workshop by Adebanji Alade "The Addictive Sketcher" - I really enjoyed the practice and simple reminder of the key steps:

<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->3. fill the dark shadows
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->4. add the midtones

The challenge is always to get the angles and proportions right at the start but through practice I am trying to get better at "seeing" the shapes of the shadows.

I have tried many "how-to" books and tutorials and they all helped but there are two books and one video course that really unlocked drawing for me:

<!-- wp:list-item -->- _Drawing on the right side of the brain_ by Betty Edwards
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- _Beginning Drawing Atelier_ by Juliette Aristides
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- _How to draw from beginner to master_ a video tutorial course by Joseph Patrick Daniels 
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- /wp:list -->

I am still working through these (keeping motivated on your own is hard!) but the key lesson in all of them is that drawing is about learning to see.
