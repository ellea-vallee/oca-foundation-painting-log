In this last exercise, I tried to incorporate the impasto technique into a study. I used a 24 x 30 cm canvas board and acrylic paint for this study. As subject matter I used a painting by Wayne Thiebaud. I am a big fan of his paintings, both in terms of subject matter, colour palettes and technique. I particularly like his paintings of cakes and sweets. I had never used a paint knife before so this really was more an exploration than a study! I was curious to see if I could reproduce the style of "Cupcake" an oil painting on canvas which Thiebaud completed in 2000.

I really liked the pastel tones around the cake and the bright blues, reds and yellows around the cake and lines. I learnt that Thiebaud called this "halos" and discovered them accidentally.

> To create bright color, Wayne hit on the idea of outlining shapes like the cupcakes in vivid blues and greens. The "rainbow" edges came about accidentally. Wayne's method of starting a painting was to sketch in the shapes in a light color, such as yellow. Then he went back and added deeper colors. As he layered the paint some of the color underneath remained as outlines and he found that he liked these "halos." At last he had developed a style of painting that was uniquely his.

Then again, I happened to visit the National Gallery over the weekend and noticed that Van Gogh had used a similar technique on his chair!

## The study
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I began with a rough sketch of the cupcake. Then I chose a standard colour palette (primary yellow, ultramarine blue, and magenta) with white and ochre as well as unbleached titanium. I tried to apply some of the paint directly onto the board and mix it on the board, starting with the light blue at the top. It was interesting to feel the knife "clicking" with the paint, where it was angled right against the board to spread the paint in a smooth spread. Mixing on the board, however, resulted slight variations in shades rather than a smooth uniform colour. Also, the middle section was "more pink" than I had aimed for once I had mixed it on the board.

I used a smaller paint knife for the cup cake which was more challenging. I tried to mix chocolate browns while keeping in mind the light source coming from the left. I tried to create some texture on the cupcake holder by using the side of my paint knife and shadows underneath the cupcake top, on the surface and on the back shadow.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the end, I had gone about the layering the wrong way! Reflecting on the quote, I realised the halos came out from an _initial_ three-color outline. Still, to complete the study, I added the halos at the end but I was not confident to add them with the paint knife and so decided to use oil pastels instead. I also used the pastels to increase the darkness of the shadows. Then I felt the outlines were a little too vivid, so I smudged them a little with a cloth... I'm not sure it was a good idea in hindsight!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The final image is far off from Wayne's original, but after completing the study, I'm wondering if Thibault had produced the whole painting with paint knifes. I'm wondering whether it's possible that the frosty top was made with a paint brush. Perhaps also the fact I used acrylics rather than oil paint may also have made a difference. I cannot say I'm really pleased with the result but it was interesting to have a go at this!

## Key learnings and reflections
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- This was a completely new approach and it was interesting to "just have a go at it" and experiment.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Trying to reproduce a painting I liked raised new insights and questions, I will try again!
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- In the future, I would mix the colours before I apply them to have better control on the tones.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I would also start with the tri-colour outlines although I'm not sure how I would do so without smudging (perhaps I'd have to wait for it to dry first...)
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I could still see the canvas board and comparing with Thiebaud's original, I wonder if another difference was that he would have used of a flat wood panel rather than a canvas board.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Using a painting as a prompt, however, makes it difficult to understand the lights and shadows because they have already been "interpreted" by the artist so another challenge would then to use the learnings to paint from a real cupcake next time, so I can have my cake and eat it!
