_ProblÃ¨me nÂ° 3712. Acrylic and Collage on Canvas, 25 x 25cm_

## The prompt


The aim of this study was to investigate the intersection of collage and painting techniques. It examined how selective application of acrylic paint over existing collages surfaces can create complex spatial and narrative relationships. The exercise prompt referenced Robert Rauschenberg's approach, specifically his integration of screen-printed imagery with gestural painting.



The aim of this exercise was to explore mixed-media layering and how alternating between concealment and disclosure through paint affects visual interpretation and narrative coherence.



Interestingly, I [read a little bit more](https://www.theartstory.org/artist/rauschenberg-robert/) about Rauschenberg's approach to narrative. Admittedly, I don't know how reliable the source is but I was interested to read he was happy to leave the make up of a narrative to the viewer:

> 
> Preferring to leave the interpretation of the works to his viewers, Rauschenberg allowed chance to determine the placement and combination of the different found images and objects in his artwork such that there were no predetermined arrangements or meanings embedded within the works.
> 
> 



The exercise prompt also emphasised the technical and conceptual implications of merging predetermined collaged elements with spontaneous painterly interventions, with partial obstruction of existing imagery influencing viewer engagement and meaning-making.


## My intention


I couldn't return to my analog collages (I left them at home before we left for the Christmas holidays ðŸ˜ž). So I decided to do a new piece instead.



I was looking through "Paris Match" magazines for interesting imagery and came across a striking close up of an angry gorilla in a WWF article about the battle between park rangers who protect the animals and illegal traffickers who steal and sell wood and coal to survive.



Alongside this article, there were several others about finance, space travel, computing and crosswords. Collage makes me reflect on these juxtapositions. I'm also still under the influence of James Bridle's book about "ways of being" and how everything is more connected than we think. The traffickers exist because climate change makes it harder to cultivate the soil. Burning the woods becomes a matter of survival.



I also found a little illustration using squares to make up a puzzle with different pictures in different colours and thought I could perhaps create a crossword image, crossing the gorilla photograph with images of science and technological transformation.

## The process


I used a square canvas panel and drew a grid with 6 cm squares, leaving a border of 0.5cm all around.



Then I searched through imagery which conveyed human activity, evolution and technological advancement. I also used cut outs from an old psychology handbook.



Next I glued the squares, alternating light and dark ones to create a crossword grid. I used diluted gesso to glue the paper on the board. I really liked the washed out look of the images. Finally I added a tint of acrylic colour on the lighter squares, roughened the surface with sandpaper and painted a black border with a rough gold finish before applying a gloss varnish to the whole piece.


## Reflections

- At first, I didn't feel the resulting image was very successful. The gorilla is difficult to parse together, probably because the squares are too big. 
- The more I spent looking at it, the more it grew on me. I like the "ProblÃ¨me nÂº 3712" cut out. This was from the crosswords, but collaged on the image it makes it look like an artifact from the future. 
- I like the aesthetic of the images under the transparent gesso but I'm guessing the narrative will be cryptic (although in that sense, not unlike Rauschenberg's collages). 
- I was also not satisfied by the squares, because they did not all look like squares, and some of the images ended up looking more like rectangles. If I were to repeat this, I would aim to be more precise when measuring my cuttings. 
- My only regret is that now I have used the cutouts from the book, I can't "go back". 
- I also realise I got distracted away from the prompt to alternate between actual concealment and disclosure through the application of paint since the transparent gesso was not concealing. although I think the cutout pieces of the gorilla create an illusion of concealment. Still, I will revisit this in the future, if time permits.
