How do you figure out when you need to complete exercises by to keep in with the timeline and complete the course within a year?



My understanding so far is that If you are studying a Foundation course, you are studying a standalone unit with 12 months to complete.



There are 5 sections in this unit, so I am aiming to spend 80 hours per section, to achieve 400 hours of study. This averages to approximately 10 hours per week over 40 weeks.



I've then split the time into weeks, assuming Part 1 is squeezed over 6 weeks, because we started with a two-week induction.

This may sound over the top but I have a terrible sense of time so these timelines are a scaffolding to help me situate myself to see when I am too slow or too fast! I will print this schedule up so I can easily check where I am compared to where I ought to be to complete part 1 on time. I know having the deadlines is no guarantee I will be able to stick to them but I'm hoping that at the very least, it gives me clarity.



Finally if you are reading this and wondering how I did it, you can download the excel file below. Just enter your start date and it will calculate all the deadlines for you! Let me know in the comments if you found this helpful!

## Update: Part 1 complete!


I submitted my first assignment on 29th April! The timeline really helped me stay focused and aware of when I needed to move along faster to stay on target. I've now completed the timeline for Part 2. I realised that I perhaps spent too much on the early "warm-up" exercises rather than the more demanding exercises as I progressed. This time I planned to devote more time to the last exercises and see where this takes me!
