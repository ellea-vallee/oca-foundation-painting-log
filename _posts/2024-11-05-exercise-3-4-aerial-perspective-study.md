## The prompt
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this exercise, the prompt is to use a scene focussing on colours and the change in tonal value with more saturated, warmer tones, details, and contrast in the foreground and less saturated, bluer tones, less contrast and softer edges in the background.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The goal is to spend up to 30 minutes on at least two studies in my sketchbook.

## Study 1
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this first study, I decided I wanted to try a different medium and found a tutorial on drawing for aerial perspective using chalk pastels.

It was an interesting exercise which helped me learn about layering and building on background colours. I also learnt to start with the sky which I wouldn’t intuitively do but now I can see why it makes sense to begin with what is the furthest away and finish with the defined marks and highlights. I also tried to reduce the mark making in the background and use more "smudging" to emphasize the distance.

## Study 2
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the second study, I wanted to use my own reference and try to apply what I had learnt in the tutorial. I found a couple of photo references online which had an interesting background/foreground relationship but I realised the photograph is changing the perspective (the foreground is out of focus and the details are in the middle ground).

I liked the composition and decided to keep it for reference but it also felt a little "cliché" and meaningless, so I decided to reverse to one of my holiday snapshots so I could feel a connection with what I was drawing.

I tried to use watercolour for the first study... with limited success. I am sharing only to document unsuccessful attempts and try to learn from them, no matter how frustrated I feel!

<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In this study I started with the sky and tried to remove pigments for the clouds. This did not work well as the sky got all messy. I then tried to smudge it (I guess because I had just completed the pastel study!) and it left finger prints marks in the sky (ugh!). Next, I tried to work on the clouds but I felt no connection with the medium and rather than focussing on studying my reference, I was battling with the pigments. I think the issue with watercolour is that you need to be minimalist and patient. You need to have a pretty strong idea of what you intend to do, whereas I tend to "think things through" and "edit" as I go along until I get where I want to be. In this sense, I find pastels and oil paint more relatable! Here I felt I was loosing the reference but also not managing to push the image somewhere satisfying. I decided to let this one rest and have a second go but trying to use a limited number of strokes to get "a feel" for the composition.

I was not much happier with this one. It was an over-simplification and I still didn't feel it was a good rendering of the reference. In fact I was loosing what I had found interesting about it in the first place (the composition with the foreground, the middle ground, and the background). I'm not sure if I am getting the learnings I should get from this or whether I should just give up with the watercolour medium for studies!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Reflecting on this, I searched online to read more on the purpose of art studies and found this [blog post](https://www.belindadelpesco.com/painting-studies.html/) by artist Belinda Del Pesco. There were a few things she said which resonated and helped me rethink my approach:

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- Think of painting studies as brainstorming and note-taking to build your best "painting plan" ahead of time.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Persevere and do more studies _especially_ if you think your latest one is not satisfactory.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Limit yourself to four values to simplify your studies.
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

This last piece of advice was attributed to artist and teacher [Mitch Albala](https://mitchalbala.com/exercise-simplification-and-massing-in-landscape-with-limited-values/). I really liked the prompt of simplifying complex images through using masses and limited values. This made me think of Luc Tuymans’ painting _Der Architekt_ which I just discovered while reading the _Thinking through Painting_ book and also really appreciated (but that’s for another story!).

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Coming back to the studies, I decided to have one last go using the four-value approach. To try something different from watercolours, I used my iPad and the Procreate app, with the photo showing as a reference while I was drawing with the ‘6B pencil’ brush from the sketching collection using a palette with four grey values.

It was a slow building process, much similar to the pastel drawing (but also much less messy!). I tried adding the clouds in the sky but in the end, I preferred the high contrast of the white sky.

## Reflections and learnings
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I’m (slowly!) learning to better understand what a painting study is — a way to brainstorm and record rather than an aesthetically pleasing drawing (although an unsatisfying study means I need to persevere).
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I am keen to explore more the “simplifying mass” technique.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I understand the principles of colour perspective but haven’t yet been able to fully apply them (apart possibly in study 1).
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Questions
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- Is it worthwhile investing time in persevering with watercolours for the studies? I can't make my mind up about this one!
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- What can I do to improve my colour skills? I love colourful artworks but somehow I find it difficult to be purposeful in my colour choices, I have no intuition. I read books but when it comes to choose what colour pigments to put on canvas I am still a bit clueless. I have a colour wheel but I don't really know how to use it to pick my colours.
