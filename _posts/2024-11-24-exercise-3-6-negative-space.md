## The prompt
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The aim of this exercise was to explore negative space, paying attention to compositions with strong and simple forms and work on compositions focussing on the negative spaces and make a comparative study of a composition focussing on positive shapes and negative shapes using acrylic, watercolour or ink.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Sketchbook studies
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I really like negative space drawings. The examples below are charcoal I completed in 2022. I enjoy using objects as prompt and focusing on the negative shapes and lines created by the design.

I love the sharp contrast and the texture. I kept this exercise in mind when we went on a trip to Oxford last weekend and selected a snapshot of a couple of high stools by the bar at a restaurant.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I did a few practice studies in my sketchbooks, inspired by the _Wayne Thiebaud, draftsman_ book, I drew different frames to explore different compositions.

_Exploring forms in negative shapes. Graphite on A5 paper_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

After the first small sketches, I felt constrained by the small format and so I switched to my A4 sketchbook. The proportions are still giving me trouble but focussing on the negative spaces helped me let go of the tyranny of what "things look like." I also enjoyed shading the negative spaces rather than the forms.

_Further "private" studies of negative spaces. Graphite on A4 paper_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the last sketch, I changed the frame to a square and explored how I could make the negative shapes more "blocky". I liked the contrast and simplicity of the shapes and tones. I decided to develop that last square composition for the comparative study of positive and negative shapes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Comparative studies
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For both studies, I used carbon paper to help me get the "correct" lines and proportions. I saved and printed a crop version of my original photograph in black and white. My printer is running out of ink so the print was of poor quality but I quite liked it, it was like an "accidental squinting"!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I used acrylic for both studies. I hadn't used it in a while and it was fun to rediscover it. I noticed that my interaction with this medium had changed a lot! I was more confident in mixing colours to get the shade I wanted, and also quite fast with my brush. I felt a little more control over the texture (rough and dry versus smooth or even transparent with water). I also enjoyed the possibility of layering very quickly.

#### Colour palette
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the colour palette, I was inspired by Marianne Werefkin's _the Dancer_. I went to see the exhibition at the Tate a few weeks back and got a few postcards which I have hanged on the wall, alongside other paintings I saw from the Albertina in Vienna last summer. I do love those deep blues and the salmon cheeks. I picked Prussian blue and mixed fluorescent pink with yellow ochre to get the vibrant salmon.

### Study 1 - Starting with the subject
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the first study I started by painting the chairs with the tip of a round brush. I was trying to pay attention to the highlights. When the chairs were complete, I worked on the background also trying to pay attention to where the light was falling on the picture.

<!-- /wp:gallery --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was OK but I was not too happy with the result. I noted that, despite the graphite studies, I felt like I didn't have a plan, I was making things I was went along. I did have fun playing with the acrylic but the blues were all over the place. Filling the background after the objects meant there was no unity to the background and each negative space was filled with different shades of blue.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the end I let go of the exercise and picked up two Sennelier oil sticks—an iridescent white and a Payne's grey—to add highlights and shadows. The white is a bit transparent but it added in interesting shine to the painting where the white glows or disappears as a function of the angle at which you look at it. I realised I needed to apply the black with a brush or else it would be too think so I used my smaller bristle brush to add shadows. I also unified the background by adding a line for the darker shadow. It was not in the reference photograph but I felt this helped the composition.

The final study is still a little messy but I felt more satisfied with it. I liked the graininess and the texture of the final piece.

### Study 2 - Starting with the background
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Next I reproduced the same outline with the carbon paper but this time tried to work out a plan which I wrote at the top of my sketchbook. That kind of helped as a prompt but, re-reading it at the end, I was surprised to see how much I had deviated from it!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {"id":1195,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->

<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I started by filling in the background shapes with an undiluted raw dark Prussian blue. Then I used a lighter hue of blue with unbleached titanium for the floor and the top line. Finally I used a middle tone for the wall on the left. When I was done I felt the chairs were too white so I worked on them, mixing the same salmon colour but this time used it for the bars. Then I used a highly diluted blue for the chairs. The last detail I added were the darker shades of lines on the wall and finally I used a Posca white for the highlights.

### Reflections
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I enjoyed this exercise. It occurred to me that I seem to be more inspired by designed objects (bottles, utensils, chairs), than by natural forms.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Another observation was that my written thoughts immediately after completing a piece were quite harsh and negative! The last details I added at the end brought the piece up (at least for me!) and that made me think it can't have been that bad to begin with (i.e., I need to tame that inner monologue!).
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Comparing the two studies, I can see that focussing on the negative shapes allowed me to unify the background, making the second study look "flatter" and less painterly, more "graphicky". I'm not sure if it's due to how I approached the studies (positive vs. negative space first) or to me using a different approach altogether for both studies (blending and shading in the first study vs. blocks of colours in the second study). Probably a mix of both.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I think I preferred the outcome of the first study because the gradients and the texture made it more interesting. It was also less controlled, which was both more fun and more frustrating.

### Questions
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- How do I approach critiquing my own work beyond "I think it's OK" or "I think it's not good"? Am I focussing on the right things to reflect on?
