For this exercise, I explored how figures and their settings work together to create meaning in paintings. I started by developing studies before moving to a final piece, focussing on the arrangement of forms and light. I enjoyed looking at Hopper's work to reflect on the possibilities for depicting people in spaces, which informed my approach to the task.



I started by looking through my figure studies and self-portraits to understand how to position figures in a new context. Even though I enjoy looking at portraiture, this is not something I feel ready to tackle yet (if ever) so I chose to focus on distant figures, akin to the people in [Towards the Sea](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/category/coursework/part-3/exercise-3-5-larger-perspective-study/).


## Preliminary research


I found a fascinating study for the Morning Sun by Hopper where he labelled all the colours on a figure (possibly his wife, from [what I read](https://whitney.org/artists/621)). This made me think about my own challenges when it comes to colour mixing and how having a plan like this could help me to remain more in control of my colour choices. This also made me reflect on how I could practice naming the colours to train myself to see them better.

I really love the strong light and shadows, the purples and oranges, the simplicity of the scene, the intimacy which we are witnessing, it's a striking image.

I also looked at work from [Caroline Walker](https://www.instagram.com/carolinewalkerartist/?hl=en), [Edouard Vuillard](https://cdn2.oceansbridge.com/2017/09/06184642/The-Flowered-Dress-Edouard-Vuillard-oil-painting.jpg), or [Peter Doig](https://www.instagram.com/peterdoig/). I found them all fascinating in their scenery and the unspoken narrative which their images convey although my preference is still for the simplicity and intimacy of Morning Sun. No one in my family is keen to be a poser so I reverted to photographs as a source. I had one image in mind, of my elder playing Fortnite looking at the screen in a position that reminded me of Hopper's wife but I haven't taken the photograph yet.



Looking back through my phone pictures, I found a picture I took of my daughter looking out a college room window when we visited in Oxford. She's a big fan of Philip Pullman, and Lyra, the main character from the Book of Dust. She was pensive and probably "transposed" in the book's story at that time. I decided to work from this composition instead.


## Studies


I started with a few vignette pencil drawings in my sketchbook using the photograph on my phone as a reference and experimenting with different viewpoints by cropping the image.

Then I thought working from the phone was too limiting. I wanted to be able to look at an image. I also wanted to work from a filtered image, with "vintage" colours like in Wes Anderson's work.

## Final piece (WIP)


I first tried to transfer the image loosely on the canvas through brush strokes by looking at it but it wasn't precise enough to my liking.



Next I reverted to transfer from tracing paper.

But I realised I didn't enjoy that process and somehow was missing collage. So I decided to use the same approach as I did for my self portrait but this time use a faint photograph as an underpainting.



I first used a black and white picture and glued the edges and then applied collage gel medium on top with a brush.

It really didn't work well! I thought last time I had applied gesso on the canvas first, then gesso on the back of the paper and then gesso on top. I still had folds but not so many bubbles because the paper was soaked.



Next I tried with a faint colour photograph, and applied the medium in a linear way starting from the top, first on the canvas, applied the paper and then brushed it over with medium again.



The result was a bit better. Although it was still quite a bit bubbly, I really liked the aesthetic. I tried to get rid of the bubbles with a plastic card tool. It ripped the paper a bit but I also liked that. It reminded me of the wabi sabi aesthetic which I had read about earlier and the beauty in the "imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete" which Leonard Koren talked about.

My ultimate intention was then apply oil paint on this under painting, perhaps highly diluted, perhaps leaving some areas without paint.



However I have to leave this now and move on to the next exercises ahead of the looming submission deadline. Letting go is a big deal but it's part of me learning to better manage my time.



Also I felt I need more practice to achieve what I am looking for with this first phase.



I was reminded of a childhood memory watching people applying a glueish mixture and pieces of papers on billboards to reveal an ad or a film poster. I must have been fascinated by this because I can see the bristles of the brush, the grey glue leaking in my minds eye.



I asked a LLM about this and within two prompts I got an answer (isn't this technology amazing!):

> Ah, now I understand - you're thinking of wheat pasting or "poster paste" techniques! This is a great approach that actually dates back centuries. Here's how to adapt that street art technique for your collage:

> 
> - Mix 1 part flour with 2 parts cold water until smooth
> - Add 4 parts boiling water while stirring
> - Cook on low heat until translucent and thick
> - Let cool before use

> 
> 
> - Dampen your base surface lightly
> - Apply a thin layer of paste with a wide brush
> - Place your image and smooth from center out
> - Apply another very thin layer over top
> - Use a clean rubber squeegee or plastic card to work out bubbles
>

> This method actually works well with thinner papers like your printer paper because the paste dries slowly and evenly. The key is using broad, confident strokes when applying the paste and working quickly before the paper gets too wet.

This gave me lots of food for thought. I actually like the idea of cooking my own paste! I also then searched for poster paste technique and found [an article in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/magazine/how-to-wheat-paste-posters.html#:~:text=Print%20your%20poster%20on%20thin,over%20the%20top%20to%20seal.) (probably one of a source for the LLM!). So I plan to see if I can use this for the next exercise.

## Reflections

- I really liked this prompt and studying Edward Hopper's paintings. I am more enthused by painting the figure in context to tell a story.
- I do find portraits fascinating to look at but there is a huge skill gap and I'm not sure whether this is where I want to put my efforts to improve. 
- I am also learning to let go to spread my efforts through time. I think this is going to be my biggest challenge and the one thing that makes me wonder whether I can afford to go onto a Degree while working full time.
- Even though I didn't get to apply any paint on this piece, I know it's now ready for me to get to work and a much better substrate than a blank canvas. 
- I was also inspired by the concept of "painting beyond itself". At a time when a "painting" can be an LLM prompt and given all the digital tools available, I feel the outcome is already painterly. I find the mix of digital and analog process, old and new, quite interesting to explore. 



PS. I wrote the blog when the collage was still wet but when I returned to the piece later on, the medium had dried and the bubbles had gone.
