## Mixing Warm and Cool Secondary Colours
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In this exercise, I mixed colours and applied them to a small board. I began with oil colours from a small student set. At first, I decided to work with two sets of yellow, red, and blue: ultramarine, crimson, and naples yellow on the one hand, cerulean blue, cadmium light red, and cadmium yellow, on the other.

_Paint and tools I used for the colour mixing_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I began by mixing ultramarine and crimson in equal proportions, and got a very dark violet.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Next I mixed crimson with Naples yellow and I got a vintage rose.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I moved to the other trio of colours. I mixed the cadmium red with the cerulean blue and was surprised to get a chocolate brown! Finally I mixed the cadmium red with the cadmium yellow and I got a bright orange.

I enjoyed playing with the paint samples and created a digital collage for fun!

Next I wanted to better understand the idea of "muted" and "vibrant" mixes so I followed the prompts and designed a chart to compare the results.

_Muted and vivid mixes_
<!-- /wp:jetpack/image-compare --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I was getting there, I could tell the vibrant colours were lighter, except for the vibrant violet, which appears almost black. I searched through my books to see if I find a better explanation and found a great insert in an old copy of Hazel Harrison's book "How to Paint & Draw".

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:table -->

I completed the crossings prompt but I must admit I am not sure what this was meant to demonstrate. The oil was still fresh and it got all muddy. Perhaps I didn't dilute it enough or did not use the right medium to dilute it (I used linseed oil). Perhaps this is an exercise in transparency?

_Crossing experiment with oil paint_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I also wanted to experiment with acrylics to see the difference. I really enjoy oil paints but cleaning the brush between each colour and cleaning the palette is hard work and the smell is not great.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I worked mostly with yellows and reds. The variety is interesting but it is also a little confusing. Also the same colour name can look quite different from one brand to the other! I am not sure that I will be able to remember those details when they would perhaps be needed for an actual future painting but at least I have a log to refer back to now! I was able to recreate the vivid combinations: primary magenta & primary yellow and cadmium red & cadmium yellow. When I tried the Liquidex magenta quinacridone & primary yellow, it didn't work so well, partly because the texture was "runnier" (perhaps that is why the paint is called 'Liquidex'?)

To complete this series, I wanted to experiment with different colours. I have a set of bright liquidex acrylic colours which I really like, inspired by a [blog post by artist Jessi Raulet](https://www.ettavee.com/blog/vibrant-color-mixing-with-acrylic-paint). I wanted to see what secondary colours I would get. For the last canvas I filled, I tried to play with transparency. I don't think the outcome was very successful but then again I didn't put much thought into it and I didn't paired the colours well.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I do love these bright colours yet I am not sure why yet. Perhaps because I'm a child of the 1980s and I wore them! They are also the colours that surround us in our overly consumerist, plastic-infused society. If I look around me, I am surrounded by these hues. They also represent diversity and sunny culture, like African or Mexican multicolored art. So I have a kind of love-hate relationship with these colours! I also red the Wabi Sabi book by Leonard Koren and am really inspired by the philosophy of understated, imperfect beauty, as opposed to Modernism. At the same time, I like lightness and brightness... There is an interesting contradiction here I need to keep exploring.

## Mixing Greens
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this experiment, I divided an A5 board into 9 areas and squeezed out three different yellows (Naples yellow, primary cadmium yellow, and cadmium yellow deep hue), and blues (cerulean blue, primary phtalo blue, and ultramarine) on my palette.

_Set-up for my first grid of green mixing_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The result was quite surprising. The Naples yellow mixed with the three blues to give wonderful hues of turquoise. Apart from the Naples yellow + Cerulean blue, the last two hues were more blue than green but all very marine, I really liked them! The greens mixed from primary yellow were more vibrant, very much the greens you would see in nature, but a little more "middle of the road". The last three shades were more muted and more interesting. They reminded me of Henri Rousseau's "Dream" painting.

I felt the colours were very dark as all the blue hues were dark to begin with. I wondered what hues I would get by mixing the yellows with a tiny bit of blue each time. So I set up the palette again, but this time I used two squeezes of yellow for a tiny amount of blue.

I was pleased with the results. Again, I really liked the hues mixed with the Naples yellow. This may become a favourite! I also liked the light cadmium mixes more. It's really impressive how different they look. I couldn't guessed what I would get, it was really a case of experimenting!

<!-- /wp:jetpack/tiled-gallery --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

To mix different hues of brown, I used three sets of red, yellows and blue: (1) Cadmium red, cadmium yellow and ultramarine; (2) cyan blue, magenta, and primary yellow; and (3) quinacridone magenta, turquoise, primary yellow and fluorescent pink. I am not a big fan of brown, except when it relates to chocolate so I used my swatches to create different shades of chocolate!

<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the black and grey, I used two mixes: (1) ultramarine (Pebéo) and burnt umber (Daler Rowney), and (2) petal emerald + naphthol red light (Winsor & Newton). I really liked the phtalo-naphtol black. I had just read that Leonardo invented [aerial perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_perspective) (Bolton, 2004). This led me to explore artists who have used this technique and discover a wonderful painting by Caspar David Friedrich.

I thought I'd challenged myself to do a simple (ahem) painting in grey using darker grey in the foreground and lighter grey in the background.

_Paint and tools used to create an aerial perspective study_
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- /wp:group --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I used a photograph from Pinterest as a source of inspiration and a small canvas board. I found it amazing that you can create shades of grey from red and green, it's quite magical! The painting was a mitigated success. The shades of grey worked well but the white wall on the right confused me and in the final picture it's not clear where it stands in space. Then I think I might have ruined the effect in the end by using a black Posca pen. It added too much contrast and worked against the intended "atmospheric" effect. I tried to add a translucent of grey over it to diminish the impact of my mistake. It helped a little, I think. I let it go in the end as this was only meant as a study, not a finished piece.

## Final reflections
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Once again I've learnt a lot from this exercise:

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- Colour names and hues vary from brand to brand so I need to keep a log of names _and_ brands to know how I created hues I like.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- There are colours which "work together" and create vibrant hues (such as cadmium red and cadmium yellow) and others which "cancel each other out" and create muted hues (such as crimson red and cadmium yellow).
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- You need to keep experimenting and recording results to learn what hues you can get from various mixes and proportions. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I'm still puzzled and intrigued by the dichotomy of modernism and wabi-sabi
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I enjoy applying paint on the canvas with a paint knife.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- That you can get blacks and grey by mixing ultramarine blue and burnt umber or naphthol red with phtalo green is mind-blowing! 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I enjoy using my little dotting pens to create some "sgraffito" marks. I noticed that when I used them on oil paint, it creates a mark but it leaves the colour. When I used them on acrylic paint, however, it lifts the paint and creates a white line, which is an interesting way to create a highlight.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I enjoy oil painting and acrylic painting. I'm not sure how I would decide between the two for a given project. Perhaps at some point I need to experiment doing the same with both to better understand their respective pros and cons.
