## The prompt and intention
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

This assignment explores the development of facial observation and the application of colour theory in portraiture through a gestural self-portrait study, emphasizing structural analysis over photorealistic representation.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Through a systematic progression from preliminary sketches to painted studies, I aimed to demonstrate an investigation of various media and their respective capabilities in capturing facial topography. The methodology employed emphasized rapid execution and spontaneous mark-making, facilitating a more intuitive understanding of facial proportions and planar relationships. The subsequent painted study, executed with a curated palette of flesh tones, aimed to explore the nuances of colour mixing and the technical considerations inherent in building chromatic complexity through layered application.

## Preliminary studies
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I found the prompt to engage in rapid execution and spontaneous mark-making rather daunting because my weakness is accuracy. I still need a lot of scaffolding to place my marks on the surface and I know that portraiture is especially unforgiving for "getting it wrong".

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I began by going back to my "Drawing Atelier" workbook by Juliette Aristides and completed a few pencil drawing exercises to get into the practice.

I find the blocking of shadows the most difficult. I can reproduce the lines and once they are there, I know I have a strong scaffold for the final drawing. However, when it came to work on my own portrait (yikes!) I realised the lighting was key without having a clue for what a good lighting was. Also looking at the selfies made me feel old and "out of date". I didn't really enjoy spending time looking at my wrinkles and flabby skin! In the quick study (below) I can see how the eyes are too far apart, the face is not long enough.

Next I tried to work on blocking out shadows on my iPad. I enjoyed playing with overlays again. The final drawing was aesthetically more pleasing although still too complex.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Finally I returned to the graphite drawing the next day because it was just too awful! I thought I had identified what was wrong with it when writing the post so I might as well try to rectify these issues. It is still not quite right but it's definitely more in the right direction.

### Laying the ground
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the final study, I took a lot of photographs from different angles, positioning myself against the window trying different "angles" and experimenting with the light and filters to help me "see" the shadows and colours. I tried to use a grid to draw but I just couldn't make it work. Through these shots, though I realised I really didn't like the pictures looking at me directly (I could see too much the face of my mother scolding me!). Instead I experimented on looking away and finally found an image which I was happy to work from for the final study (the last one in the gallery).

I still felt I didn't have the skills to paint it. I didn't want to use the grid again because I find it too tedious. For the collage exercise, I had been skim reading Rod Judkins' book "[Figurative Painting with Collage](https://www.jacksonsart.com/figurative-painting-with-collage-book-by-rod-judkins)" and liked the idea of collaging pictures on the canvas with Gesso to provide ground to work from. So I printed a grayscaled photograph on standard printer paper and applied Gesso on an A4 canvas board. It got a bit messy because I didn't apply Gesso on the edges and the paper did not adhere well (it worked better if I gesso both the canvas and the paper). I tried to push it down but the paper was still too wet and it rubbed off. I liked the roughened aging effect though, it's how I feel about my self-portrait! So I pushed this and got sanding paper to make it smooth.

### Applying skin tones
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I decided to continue with acrylic for the skin tones. I wanted to keep it simple and mix cadmium red/burnt sienna, with cadmium yellow/yellow ochre, and white. In the end, I realised I also needed ultramarine for the shadows. I also printed a collage of four versions of the photograph with variations in contrast and looked at my phone for the colours (my printer is broken and I couldn't get it to print in colour!).

<!-- /wp:jetpack/tiled-gallery --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I was struggling and realised that I was working too much with the red and purple and not enough with the yellows. I spent a good few hours struggling with this so in the end, I let it rest and planned to return on it the next day with a new palette. Later on at night, I returned to it and sanded it so that the acrylic would not get too thick.

### Deciding to stop

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->

The next morning I went back to look at the sanded picture and I felt I didn't want to touch it. The heightened pink had a vintage aesthetic and reminded me of the 1950s magazines with "colorised" pictures. The artificial aging of the sanding added to the vintage portrait feeling and resonated with my own feeling of "becoming old" and "morphing into my mother" as I was working on this portrait! I showed it to my spouse and he said it looked great as it was, which convinced me to keep it there for now. I might varnish it later or revisit the skin tones but for now it is on standby, frozen in time, as it were.

## Reflections
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- Capturing "facial topography" is very difficult but I know it is essential for creating likeness (and "humanness"!).
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I find the gap between completing an exercise in a workbook and doing it on my own quite a gigantic leap and I am not sure why. I'm a master copyist but somehow I can't transfer these skills to my own portrait. Perhaps because of the lighting?
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I knew I couldn't develop the skills in time for this exercise so I used a "work-around" approach with collage inspired by another artist.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Through this experimenting and "happy accidents" (the borders, the sanding), what were potential flaws (the torn paper, the reddish colour mixing) ended up as "springboards" to help me think about what I was creating (beyond the technical issues).
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- In the end, the interplay between the "dramatic" look in the distance and the exaggerated colours worked together to create an interesting effect.
