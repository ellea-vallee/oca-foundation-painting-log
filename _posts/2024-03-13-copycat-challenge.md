For the copycat challenge I chose a painting by Clara Peeters which I discovered through the breadcrumb challenge. It's called "Still life with flowers of gold cups of honour" and is an oil painting on oakwood. I've always been very impressed by this kind of meticulous and detailed painting although even though I am not a big fan of the lavish baroque style and brownish colours, I like that the still life is telling a story. I also like the balanced composition where the gaze always find something interesting to look at and rediscover something new everytime. I also really liked the hidden portraits in there.&nbsp;

I was thinking this represents a celebration in 1612, what would be a contemporary version? I began by listing what the still life would retain and I felt the flowers should stay because nature is the only constant, the rest were possessions which needed to be updated. I thought about what celebration looks like to me? It started with the idea of a simple celebration: a glass of wine, a bowl of crisps, that's my kind of Friday celebration! that was my first sketch. Then as I was working on this, I thought I needed to be closer to the piece's idea of a celebration. So I "upgraded" my objects to what would feel like to true celebration to me: and that would be a bottle of veuve Clicquot champagne and a box of macarons (although I realise afterwards the plate in the original painting does not contain Pretzels, but a golden chain haha). For the coins, I used a mobile phone (because I've long stopped using coins to pay...), and for the shells, I thought they represented travel, so I represented a set of car keys... I'm not so sure about that last choice but I thought I had to complete this.&nbsp;

This exercise raised a few questions. I'm not sure if I would have the rights to include an actual veuve clicquot bottle as this is probably a registered trademark?! Also, I wanted to use a contemporary vase (looking at Clara Peeters' painting made me think there are uncredited artisans who made the luxurious vase, cups, and plate!). I found a vase by ceramics artist [Yo Thom](https://www.instagram.com/yothomstudiopottery/?hl=en-gb) which I really liked both for the organic, non-symetrical shape and for the mark making. I was thinking I should change it but then again this is a [copy cat](https://learn.oca.ac.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=25671) challenge and in the original, Peeters probably used a real object too? Here again, I'm not sure what's OK and what's not... Is it really OK to go by the "Steal like an Artist" mantra from [Austin Kleon's book](https://austinkleon.com/steal/)??? Opinions might differ but where does the legal line stands?

I did all of this on the iPad because it offers more scaffolding tools to create an ambitious project like this in a short period of time! I can easily erase and refine, change colours, move things around, paste and outline. It's a most versatile sketchbook for collages, and brainstorming. The final piece is using my favourite paint colours (bright ultramarine and cadmium yellow!).
