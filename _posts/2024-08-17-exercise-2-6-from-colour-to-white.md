For this last exercise, the prompt was to experiment with making a still life painting that appears to be white but is in fact a combination of subtle colour mixes.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"className":"wp-block-heading"} -->
## Setting up
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I began by selecting my colours and thinking about my still life. I decided to build upon feedback from Part 1 and revisit Morandi's still life compositions.

_Selection of colours_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I wondered if I could read something about Morandi's sense of composition and did a quick search in my library's catalog. The first article I found was quite intriguing... It was published in a journal called Leonardo, written by artist [Guido Salimbeni](http://www.guidosalimbeni.it) and colleagues. Salimbeni is also a computer scientist and the article discussed a model to generate "optimal" compositions based on generative AI.

<!-- /wp:embed --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The article proposes "a computational technique to assist the painter or the designer in the selection of the most aesthetically pleasing composition for the work" and positions itself in line with "the emergence of a new collaborative approach to design between the computer and the artist" (Salimbeni et al., 2022, p. 58). Their system uses a database of 300 3D models and associated aesthetics judgments by artists. We are not told who made these judgements and I wondered whether there was a gold standard or a cultural norm or idiosyncrasies for what makes a "good composition". The article concludes by telling us the system provides an "approach to the generation of images that can be used by a painter to expand and expedite the creative decision of a pictorial composition" (p. 59). That made me wonder and bemoan the constant search for "optimisation and speed" in our society. What are we learning or experiencing when we rush through to expedite? What are we seeking? What are we losing out by bypassing the process of thinking and reflecting and, instead, delegating all that to the machine? Is it part of our natural evolution and progression? Should I embrace it or fight it? I won't answer that today but that's definitely a topic that bemuses me.

### Inspiration
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Rather than using the computer output, I decided to stick with my human brain and picked one original simple still life by Morandi as a starting point.

_Still life by Giorgio Morandi (1955)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I picked this particular still life for its minimal simplicity. I found [a high resolution version on Sotheby's website](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2023/modern-evening-auction/natura-morta) (and was shocked to discover it was put for auction in 2023 for between 1 and 1.5 millions US dollars!). I enjoyed zooming in and studying the detailed marks. For instance, I realised he outlined the bottles carefully with the background colour while further away from them, the brush marks were more dynamic and zigzagging.

### Prepping up
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I decided to set up a still life with two objects. I had picked a few blue and white objects earlier this summer at a car boot sale and settled on a little white cup and a blue glass jar. I chose them also because they shared a similarity in contrast to the original still life by Morandi. The shapes were larger but the glass pot was more modern and bold while the white cup was more rounded and delicate.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I was constrained by time but I also wanted to take a different approach: paint in one session while looking at a still life rather than looking at a photograph. I was also aiming to practice drawing without a grid.

_Prepping to paint_
<!-- /wp:gallery --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I tried different positions and decided on a composition with some overlap between the cup and the pot until I found some interesting negative spaces between the two objects (who knows what the AI would think of that!). I felt the pot was too dark so I gessoed the inside. I initially used a white paper as background but then I thought that brown would help me better see the white cup.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I started with a warm up exercise, drawing with paint on paper. The drawing was not precise but doing it allowed me to switch my mind to looking at negative spaces, line angles and shapes, so I find it useful.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Moving paint
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The next day I was ready to start the painting. While I was away from the canvas I remembered drawing instructions from [Juliette Aristidis' atelier book](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Drawing-Atelier-Instructional-Sketchbook/dp/1580935125/ref=sr_1_3?qid=1549754070&refinements=p_27%3AJuliette+Aristides&s=books&sr=1-3&text=Juliette+Aristides) (which I highly recommend!) where she explained that to draw shapes, it's best to first "find the straight lines" and then draw curves within the lines.

_Attempting to block in the shapes from the pots_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I used that prompt on the canvas. I also decided to challenge myself to use a bigger canvas and work standing up on a 30 x 40cm tripled primed cotton canvas. I’ve had a large white canvas staring at me for years—literally. Yet, I’ve painted walls instead. Why are we so scared of larger surfaces? Is it the fear of getting it wrong? The fear of wasting paint? These fears, in reality, are not rational, they are just barriers we put in front of ourselves. I like that this course provides me with a safety net, allowing me to experiment without worry. If anyone asks, I’m just practicing!

<!-- /wp:jetpack/tiled-gallery --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Next I focused on the ground and mixed raw umber with Titanium White. I used a large "hog bristle" flat brush to get some texture in the ground. I also noticed how in Morandi's piece the back of the ground was slightly darker and I tried to aim for this effect too. It made me realise how he could have stayed so many hours doing these seemingly simple still life pieces which in fact are rather subtly complex.

<!-- /wp:jetpack/tiled-gallery --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Next I completed the background and mixed a tiny amount of cerulean blue with white. Finally, I focussed on the objects. I should set up a camera to record how I do this because now it is over, I have forgotten how I got there! All I have at the end is a messy palette and messy hands and some kind of a blackout. All I know is, it can be so mesmerising and calming to get in the flow of moving paint. I know that I have proclaimed it was finished several times, and then saw something that I wanted to change and the temptation was too great. In the end I blurred some edges, reshaped some curves, redid the line in the background several times.

The picture below shows the before / after the little tweaks. The first one was taken at 12:46 and the last one at 13:35. I also noticed how the colours are slightly different each time I take a picture, depending on when, and where I take it. I'd like to learn how to be more consistent, or record the painting with its true colours although perhaps I would need to dig out a DSLR camera for this rather than rely on my iPhone.

I photographed it again later in the day and the colours appear closer to what I saw when looking at the final piece _in situ_.

### Reflections and learnings
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I'm not sure I fully met the objectives of the exercise prompt. In the end I only used three colours mixed with white: cerulean blue and raw umber. I tried a bit of yellow ochre but I didn't quite "see" colours in the white of the white cup. Perhaps I should try with another white subject.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I enjoyed thinking more about composition in the Morandi pieces! I find composition a bit mystical. I know about the rules of thirds and focal points and also rules but in the end I can never quite tell why I picked one arrangement over another or what I could do to improve a chosen composition. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Even though I only used three colours, on reflection, I am learning more as I go along. I was able to look at the original Morandi and see the blueish beige background and recreate it on my palette fairly easily. I don't think I could have done that so consciously back in March when I started!
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I can't tell whether my first stop was better than my last. The final piece doesn't look photorealistic but I didn't mind so much. It's slightly softer and refined.
