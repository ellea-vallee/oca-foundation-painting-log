When looking at artwork from Chinese painters, you can immediately tell that they have a very different approach to represent perspective compared to the Western masters. While the traditional European approach is very mathematical with its perspective lines and vanishing points, the Chinese approach appears freer, and looser, more "dream-like".



I looked at different examples, from books and online sources to better understand and appreciate these differences.



In the collection of the [collection of the British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/search?school_style=Chinese%20paintings%2Fprints%20schools), I found an arresting painting of a boat by artist Yu Ren from the 1500s.

I can see how the perspective is created through changes in contrast and details, where the foreground provides sharper transitions from light to dark and the distance objects (the mountains on the left, the small tree on the right) are more greyed out. The focus is on the middle ground, the tree and the rock are the center piece. The dark area at the bottom, suggestive of a pier is physically closer but somehow also blurred out.



Another painting I found as a reproduction in E.H. Gombrich's (1959) _Art and Illusion: A study in the psychology of pictorial representation_. Gombrich explains that to create the illusion of space, the viewer must first be provided with a 'screen' —an empty or ill-defined area where they can "project" the expected image. Apparently Chinese Art theory discusses "the power of expression through the _absence_ of brush and ink" with a maxim "_i tao pi pu tao_—idea present, brush may be spared performance". Gombrich then quotes "another Chinese treatise" to highlight how the shiny empty surface of the silk is as integral to the image as the brushstrokes:

> When the highest point of a pagoda reaches the sky, it is not necessarily to show the main part of its structure. It should seem as if it is there, and yet is not there; as if it exists above and yet also exists below. Hillocks and earth mounds show only the half; the grass huts and thatched arbors should be represented only by their rough outlines.
> 
> <cite>In Gombrich, 1959, p. 175</cite>



In another fascinating chapter of his book, Gombrich talks about "formulas and experiences" and compares the Chinese teachings to the European teachings. The Europeans use a "learning by rote" approach, which relied teaching via "schema and correction". There's a wonderful photograph of a Victorian drawing class, which Gombrich uses to comment on the dreariness of the method of teaching pupils to draw the schema of a leaf they could hardly have seen in their surroundings: "_Can anything be more deadening to spontaneity and imagination than the learning by rote recommended by these methods?_" (p. 128). I wholeheartedly agree! I helped me understand why I have felt so stifled by the linear perspective exercises of this section of the course!

This observation is followed by an introduction of the approach to teach art in ancient China, where pupils had to commit to memory, not schemas but a songs such as:




```
First draw four leaves.
They should vary in length.
A fifth leaf crosses them.
In this there is grace and beauty.
(...)
Ink tones should be varied.
Old and young leaves should mingle.
Petals should be light,
Stamens and calyx dark.
The hand should move like lightning;
It should never be slow or hesitant.
```

This stark difference in approach highlights how the purpose of this approach goes beyond "learning how to draw" for its own sake. The concern here is not the making of a representation of a leaf or a representation of reality. Gombrich describes it as a 'poetic evocation':



> 
> 
> The Chinese artist appears still as a 'maker' of mountains, trees, or flowers. He can conjure them up because he has learned the secret of their being, but he does so to record and evoke a mood which is deeply rooted in Chinese ideas about the nature of the universe.
> 
> <cite>Gombrich, 1959, p. 129.</cite>



I find all this fascinating. The idea of drawing from a schema or drawing from what you see, and the inescapability of being influenced by a culture, a place, and a time and what it places emphasis on: the rules and rational, scientific principles search for the "universal" in the Western world, and the poetics of the "particular mood" as it is experienced first hand, without preconception, or as it is left to be experienced by the viewer in the Asian world.

Recognising that I had wandered a little bit further than the original prompt for this task which was about the different approaches to convey perspective in Asian and European artworks, I searched for articles which may explore this a little more closely and I found an interesting article by Zhu (2024), which specifically discusses how perspective is handled in the Western and Eastern traditions.



I was drawn to the article's argument suggesting that perspective is not only a technical mean to express spacial distance but also a carrier of cultural and intellectual ideas, as it guides the flow of the viewer's eyes.



Perspective, we are told, depends on the relationship between the eye, the object of the painting, and the painted image. When applying the rules of (Western) rules of perspective, we simulate how viewers sees the natural world on the canvas.



Traditional Western paintings are often characterised by their use of " *

*focal point perspective*

*" famously exemplified by Leonardo Da Vinci's last supper, with the figure of Jesus as the central focal point and the parallel line of sight represented by the twelve disciples.

Another way to depict space and distance is " *

*colour perspective*

*" where closer objects are brighter and crisper and the objects which are further away are blurrier, less saturated and less varied. This is illustrated by "Les Glaneuses" (the Gleaners) by Jean-François Millet where the women in the foreground are depicted with warmer and more detailed colours while the distance is represented with cooler, softer, greyer tones.

Zhu also talks about "hidden" or "fading" perspective exemplified by William Turner's _Slave Ship_. I had never heard of this type of perspective but looking at the painting, I can see that it does not follow the principles of colour perspective (the colours in the distance remain bright and saturated) but still gives some sense of spatial arrangement (the outline of the boat appears blurrier in the distance, compared to the outlines of the metal clamps and the hands in the foreground)—what a harrowing picture...

Now Zhu contrasts these three Western approaches to perspective with the " *

*scattered perspective*

*" —also referred to as "moving point perspective"—, presented as the most characteristic method of perspective expression in Chinese paintings. In paintings relying on the scattered perspective, "the field of view is not limited by space, and the viewer's point of view flows up and down, left and right, far and near (...) [forming] a flowing space with multiple viewpoints" (p. 221).



This is best exemplified, we are told, by Wang Ximeng's "Thousand Miles of Mountains and Rivers" combines together multiple viewpoints in a [long stretch](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Wang_Ximeng._A_Thousand_Li_of_Rivers_and_Mountains._%28Complete%2C_51%2C3x1191%2C5_cm%29._1113._Palace_museum%2C_Beijing.jpg) of thousands of miles of rivers and mountains—which could not otherwise be seen at one glance using a fixed perspective viewpoint.

_Wang Ximeng. 1113. A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains (Section)_


The sense of perspective is given here by the "Three Distant Methods" whose origin is attributed to Guo Xi, a painter of the Northern Song Dynasty, and includes the "high and far," the "deep and distant," and the "flat and distant", each corresponding to a different angle of observation and state of mind and emotions.



> 
> 
> “High and far” emphasizes the majestic momentum of looking up at the top of the mountain from the bottom; “deep and far” expresses the far-reaching mood of overlapping mountains, twists, and turns; “flat and far” focuses on the expression of openness and flatness, The “far” is to express the open, flat and colorful scenery of the water and the sky.
> 
> 
> 
> (...) By transcending the constraints of specific time and space, the painter observes all things in nature with a fluid vision, skillfully blending macroscopic scenes with microscopic details in the same picture. This way of observation not only reflects the broad-mindedness and profound thoughts of Chinese painters but also provides infinite possibilities for the spatial expression of the picture. (...) the overall picture presents a “can be viewed, can be traveled, can be living” state.

Reading about the Western schemas in Gombrich, and the three distant methods in Zhu really helped me understand what is so special about the ancient Chinese paintings, how they capture the flow of life, encapsulate mood and connections between living entities, and represent an invitation to wander freely on a journey within the painting. I also see why the long rectangular shape of the scroll may have been instrumental (to afford or contribute?) to this approach. By contrast, the use of perspective in Western paintings appears more constrained and constraining. I understand it as a mean to "re-present" the natural world as it presents itself to the human eye. It can direct viewers to see what they had not noticed, or to see what is from a different angle but it remains static and enclosed in a "viewfinder". I have a new appreciation for Chinese art and also a better understanding of why I liked Matisse's Goldfish and the Sculpture and brought it home. It somehow closer in spirits to the "three distant methods" than to traditional approaches to perspective in Western paintings, even though it still constraints the viewer's gaze in a virtuous circle within the frame. By contrast, a painting like Huang Gongwang's is an invitation to escapism and freedom. Ironically, what transpires in the paintings is not necessarily what is reflected in livelihoods, or perhaps they all painted what they revered.
