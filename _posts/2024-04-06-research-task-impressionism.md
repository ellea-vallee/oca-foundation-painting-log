In this post, I'm comparing the work of two impressionist artists, observing their distinct approaches to using brush marks to convey movement, capture the essence of a scene and suggest the changing qualities of lights.

I've chosen to focus on Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot, two of the three great ladies (""Les trois grandes dames") of Impressionism, together with Marie Bracquemond, as [once described by Parisian journalist Gustave Geffroy who was also an early promoter of the impressionism movement](https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/women-impressionists).

## Little Girl in a Blue Armchair
<!-- /wp:heading -->

The first painting I studied was Mary Cassatt's "_Little Girl in a Blue Armchair_".

_Cassatt, Mary. Little Girl in a Blue Armchair. 1878, oil on canvas, National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, USA._

The painting captures a serene yet dynamic ambiance, typical of impressionist style, with vibrant, sketchy brush marks in blue and turquoise, particularly evident on the blue armchairs patterns, adding a dynamic dimension to the overall tranquility of the scene (see close-up below). The foreground shows a little girl who appears dressed in fine clothes but bored and "slouched" on a padded armchair in a room that is crowded with more armchairs and a small sofa but otherwise free of personal belongings.

The lighter strokes for the little dog make it appear soft and fluffy.

I can see two light sources, one coming from behind the painter onto the little girl and casting a hard shadow under her leg. This light is bright and white. Then there is a backlight coming from the window at the back of the scene. This light is toned down a bit, using more light grey (or pastel green?) and unbleached titanium hues.

## Girl on a Divan
<!-- /wp:heading -->

The second painting I studied was Berthe Morisot's "_Girl on a Divan_". This painting also uses blue and turquoise colours, but seems toned down, compared to Mary Cassatt's "_Little Girl in a Blue Armchair_". The subject fills the frame and the background is filled with a divan and a simple wall. She appears pensive, lost in her thoughts, with her gaze looking away from the viewer.

There seems to be a single light source from the left. The light on the back wall is "captured" through lighter blue brushstrokes on the left of the subject head and darker shades of blue and turquoise on her right. Similarly highlights in her light brown hair is shown through bold strokes of ochre and orange. I thought the way her hair seems to fade in the blue background gave an interesting blurry, moving effect to her hair style.

The "divan" offers a soft contrast to the blue wall and is also presented with broad pastel green strokes and muted brown patterns. The cast shadow is soft and represented in darker green and even blue strokes by the subject right ear.

There appears to be no white, the highlights on the subject's dress's lace seem to be rendered in very light orange (?) and the midtones are blue-grey. The dress creases are represented very loosely with blue and orange shadows. The face has very soft highlights and midtowns seem green. Only the eyelashes, fine eyebrows and the pupils stand out in black and only the forehead and the eyelids are a light pink, same as the nose and the mouth, which stands out, giving a feeling of liveliness that is at odd with the greenish highlights on the rest of her face. I really like this painting. It reminds me of Tolstoi's character, Anna Karenina. There is a rich life in this woman's mind!

## Final reflections
<!-- /wp:heading -->

I felt I learnt a lot from this task, both in terms of the technique (the bold brush strokes, the use of different shades blues and greens for shadows and midtones in both the paintings), the artists (Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot), and the context in which they produced their paintings.

I was also taken by the observation made by Griselda Pollock about these modern women artists, who were supported by their fathers and fellow male artists, while also painting from the intimacy of their private salons and gardens. Pollocks asked, was it intimacy or a confine? Were they free to choose to paint from these sceneries or were they still hostages to the diktats of the society they lived in, and confined to hide to paint in the privacy of women salons or gardens?

Where are we now? Reconsidering these paintings by pioneer (albeit middle-class) women artists as a representation of their lived experience and viewpoints as women was an interesting insight. What would scenes would they have painted if they lived in 2024?
