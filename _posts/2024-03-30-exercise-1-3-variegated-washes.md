I had lots of fun experimenting with this exercice, with tinges of frustration at times, which meant I spent more time on it than I ought to have. Still I got some nice (if perhaps all over the place) pieces out of this, using various types of paper, paints, and tools.


## Wet on wet 

### Experiment #1


My first variegated wash was using diluted acrylic paint, a mix of primary yellow and fluorescent pink.

_Experiment #1 - Acrylic variegated wash_


I really liked the bright colours and the soft effect of the wet on wet blending. The paper buckled quite a bit though, which is annoying. I'd have to iron it if I wanted to use it as background, I guess.


### Experiment #2

_Experiment #2 - Watercolour ink_


Next I tried my watercolour inks (I have a lot of materials which I have not used enough, and I find the practice of simply trying out very liberating...).



I started with a light acrylic wash on thin paper. It buckled again next I splattered drops of watercolour ink. I was trying to mix pink and yellow or pink and blue but avoid green mix. Some of the acrylic wash gathered in a buckle and that gave me an idea of a vase. I might return to this for the next exercise.



I noticed that the watercolour didn't spread as I would expect given that the wash was still wet. So I tried again but this time with a layer of diluted yellow watercolour ink. This really resulted in a fluffy wet on wet effect. I had a little bit too much fun and kept adding the ink and watch it move on the paper. Finally I tried on heavy 300 gsm print paper. The paper seemed to absorb the water a lot more and I got interesting very soft fluffy effects or more edgy, "cauliflower" one.



I noticed though the effects kept evolving on the print paper and what I got in the end was nothing like what I had when I stopped interacting with paint and paper. Also the ink bled under the masking tape. It would take a lot of practice to know what I'm doing or intentionally create an effect!


## Blotting wet paint

### Experiment #3

_Blotting with a natural sponge_


For this experiment I started with a turquoise acrylic wash and then used a natural sponge to blot darker values. I felt it became too dark so at the end I dipped a bit the sponge in a bit of white ink and tapped it on the right. I was quite pleased with the outcome and the texture.


### Experiment 4

_Blotting with a paper towel on Yupo paper_


I was meaning about the bloating on our study group and someone suggested Yupo paper. Since we are experimenting I gave it a try. I also had some cheap liquid watercolours and decided to play with those. I wished I could have filmed how this evolved because that paper was very surprising. It didn't seem to absorb the watercolour at all. I could really work out how to use paintbrush marks. At some point I gave up on using a brush and smudged everything I had done with a paper towel. I realised you could lift of paint and make a nice textured effect. I dipped my paper towel in a bit of purple and smudged a line and ended up playing with the towel to make a tree shape. I wanted to try to lift off paint with the liner tool but it didn't work. Still quite happy (and surprised) by the end result, the textured background and different shades.


## Laying different coloured washes side by side 

### Experiment 5


For this I used watercolour paper and a watercolour set with many shades of colour. For the first experiment I alternated analogous colours in blue, turquoise and greys.

I started in white 300 gsm water colour paper. I use a large round brush with lots of water and pigment. It was good to see how the colours blended together and how they blended only where the water touched. Somehow the brush did not hold enough water to go from one side to the other and I got a rough effect on the edges unless I added more water and pigments and went over. I suppose this is because of the (low quality) brush I am using.



I find it difficult to stop. I enjoy spending time interacting with paint. Somehow here the end effect is good but really it would have been even better if I had done it even more quickly with less strokes but what's the fun in that?




### Experiment #6


For this experiment, I used a Schminke "horadam" watercolour tester set and played around with layers of analogous colours using a smaller but better quality brush. This is possibly my favourite experiment so far. I like the graduations and the vibrancy of the colours. I also enjoyed lifting colours at the bottom.

_Experiment #6 - side by side variegated washes_

## Final reflections


I have learnt a lot from this exercise. The key insights are:



- it's best to moisten the paper with a flat brush first but don't overload it with water or even your thickest paper will buckle!



- thick paper for linocut prints is very absorbent and can give very fluffy effects when used with watercolour inks but it's very hard to control the end result.



- Yupo paper is very different. It does not seem to absorb at all but it makes it very difficult to use with a brush. However you can get interesting textured effects painting and dabbing with a paper towel!



- If I want to apply bleeding layers of variegated washes, I will probably get the best results if I use better quality paint and brushes.
