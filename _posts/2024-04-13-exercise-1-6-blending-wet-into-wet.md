In this exercise, my aim was to compare two approaches for blending. Either using subtle brush to make marks that remain visible and add texture to the surface or use a blender to gently stroke the surface of the paint to make the brush marks invisible.


## Experiment #1


I set out to do this on an A4 canvas paper. I worked from a photograph (due to logistics constraints, I couldn't do this from a live view). I added a black and white filter to the photograph to help me focus on values.

_Experiment #1 - Step 1_


I started by outlining the shapes. The proportions were off again, but the focus was on blending so I parked that worry for the time being!



I enjoyed mixing the colours and using a limited palette, I used yellow ochre, zinc white and ultramarine blue... I think. I remembered to take a picture of my palette at the end but I forgot to record what brushes I used and what paint tubes!



As an aside, I used a PVC palette for my previous experiment and was unable to clean it. This time I used a cutting board made of glass. It's much easier to clean. Although the only one we had already had a motif. I'll get a white one next.

_Experiment #1 - Painting the light background against the dark vase_


I recorded a paint brush stroke against the darker vase, to remember I can turn my flat brush to get a more precise line.

_Experiment #1 - Midway through_


I enjoyed setting the background and the contrasts between the shapes. Midway through I had some nice reflections on the bottle and decided to paint the cup in a lighter shade of blue and keep the little vase off white to create more contrast.

_Experiment #1 - Final results_


The aim of the exercise was to compare ways of blending. I found it hard to focus on this while also having to focus on the still life itself. At some point, I was lost "in the flow of the moment" and simply got going. But I also had the feeling I was not making conscious decisions. I couldn't tell you how I mixed the paint and my palette was quite disorganised in the end. I kept thinking: "oh, I need it to be a little darker here, or a little lighter there..." which is fine but it makes it hard to know exactly why I did what I did.



On the positive side, however, I was quite pleased with the highlights and the shadows. I didn't want to use black but I didn't manage to create the dark tones for the dark shadows which are simply blue! You could say it's a stylistic choice but really it was a miss. I also didn't have raw umber. I'm guessing I could have used that mixed with blue to get a darker value.



I also realised I didn't quite meet the exercise's objective (to compare modes of blending), unless perhaps as an after thought where the backlight of the dark blue vase is neater and the front light area is slightly more blurred.


## Experiment #2


I wanted to work more purposely on the different types of blending so I set up to paint a new object (an old family vintage handbag) split in the middle, with one side using paint from the tube and the other side using paint mixed with linseed oil. I used a small 13 x 18 cm cardboard frame.

The drawing was rough and it turns out to be more complicated than I thought with the various buckles and handles! I started with the background for which I used burnt umber and white and a flat brush. This time I used a transparent glass palette for mixing (I took a glass out of a photo frame!).

Unfortunately, I decided to use phthalocyanine emerald for the bag. I regretted it as I really didn't like the color, but it was too late and it was just an exercise... so I continued. I really liked the rough texture of the paint on the left, however the canvas was really showing through, and it was more difficult to control it. The brush marks were less visible on the right and it was easier to blend the highlights, somehow. Still I do feel very unsure of what I am doing. When it came to do the shadow, I didn't know how to mix it. My instinct was to mix green with brown, I don't know why, and it was a really bad instinct!

_Experiment #2 - Final result_

## Final reflections

- This exercise was meant to learn more about different ways of blending. I think I still have a long way to go and without seeing a demonstration of the instructions, it was difficult to gauge whether I approached the task the right way. 
- I did learn that the paint is easier to apply and stretch when mixed with linseed oil.
- I preferred the outcome of the first experiment. I was quite pleased with the colours and the forms. The second experiment was just a practice, but I struggled with the colour mixing (and colour choices!) as well as creating the details of the object I had chosen (which, in retrospect, was too ambitious given my current skill levels...).
- There are few interrogations I still have:
 - How can I to mix colours to create realistic cast shadows?
 - To what extent does the brush I use helped or hindered the blending?
 - What's the best set up for linseed oil and palette so that the oil does not get dirty too quickly? Should I get a clean jar for each colour? How do I keep the brush clean between colours? Do I need a brush per color? or do I need to go wash it as soon as I have finished applying a colour? Sounds right... I probably just need to be more disciplined!
