## The prompt
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

This series of figure drawing studies explores the relationship between observational context and drawing technique. While the course assignment suggested varying artistic media to capture human movement and form, I chose instead to investigate how different situational constraints affected my gestural interpretation and mark-making. The studies progressed through three phases: observational sketching of ferry passengers in transit, structured figure drawing exercises, and timed gesture drawings ranging from 30 to 60 seconds. Each context presented unique challenges in capturing human proportion, movement, and form. I concluded with an hour long study and reflections on progress throughout.

I completed the first series of sketches while we were traveling on the ferry for the holidays. The first one was of a random passenger. I felt a little uncomfortable looking at someone and drawing them without asking their permission, a similar feeling to collaging pictures of people I "snapped" in the street. After that I focused on the family in the cabin. The drawings were OK, I'm still struggling with proportions and drawing what I see, if I am unaided. I think possibly the first one, where I was drawing a complete stranger, was slightly better. The others look very "cartoonish". I also noticed that I did not include any background in the drawings so they all "floated in space". I felt I needed a little more guidance for figure drawing so I searched for a tutorial on the virtual instructor's website.

The virtual instructor's tutorial suggested a 4-step "method" using lines for the spine and the limbs and "adding meat" (!) to create the form of the figure. Next we were taken to through a series of poses to practice the method and complete the drawing in 3 to 8 minutes.

I found the exercise still made my figures a little too "stiff" and "overworked" but I liked the idea of timing myself to complete a drawing. I also felt the photographs of the poses appeared distorted (e.g., Fig. 8) so that didn't help. I asked my daughter if she would pose but she didn't want to stand still! So I searched the internet and found the [quick poses website](https://quickposes.com/en) which allows you to set up a timing and provides a timed slideshow of different poses. I tried this next.

I first tried the setting with a 30 second limit but it was way too fast! However, even if the result was barely intelligible, it really gave me a feel for a more fluid approach to the drawing, which felt liberating and which I very much enjoyed.

### 60-second sketches

Next I did another session, but this time I set the timer to 60 seconds. This allowed me more time to capture the pose without getting lost in the details. It was fast enough to prevent me from over thinking and I enjoyed that very much!

### 3-minute sketches

<!-- /wp:jetpack/tiled-gallery --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the last session, I started again but this time with a 3-minute time limit. I really liked some of the drawing. Of course they are far from "perfect" but I found them much more interesting and lively than the figure drawings from the methodic approach.

## Final study
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the final figure study I chose another random pose photograph but this time, without time constraint. I'm not sure how much I took exactly but somewhere around an hour.

# Conclusions and reflections
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I enjoyed exploring figure drawings and practicing "capturing" human proportions, movement, and form.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- The different approaches (on the ferry, using a "method" and using a timer) resulted in very different outcomes as well as more or less enjoyable processes! My sweet spot was around 60 seconds. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I can tell this would require practice to improve but I enjoyed this intuitive, perceptive "right brain" approach much more than the methodic one.
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I could tell my final study was not quite "there" compared to the original pose but I couldn't tell exactly why so I superimposed the two on my iPad and played with layers blending and transparency. The digital manipulation helped me examine the relationship between positive and negative space, lines and curves in the original photograph and the final study. It also created an unexpected "dialogue" between the traditional pencil study and the contemporary digital media which I found quite aestethically pleasing!
