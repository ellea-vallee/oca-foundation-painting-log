### Experiment 1

This first experiment ended up being my favourite experiment for this exercise. It was one I completed very intuitively "in the spur of the moment." I had finished the wash and it was not dry yet but the shapes were very appealing and I could "see" the lady. I grabbed a water colour pencil and started to draw freely on top of the shapes. It was very quick and raw, but the result felt "fresh". I also loved how the 'blooms' were vibrant saturated with bright colours.

### Experiment 2
<!-- /wp:heading -->

I enjoyed experiment #1 so much I tried it again, immediately after. The result was not so successful. I liked the bright colours but the black posca pen didn't work so well and the result was a little too busy and too "cartoonish." On the positive side, it reminded me of the truffula trees of Dr Seuss's Lorax, which I always liked!

### Experiment 3
<!-- /wp:heading -->

For this experiment I tried to create a "serious" landscape, to keep more in line with the original prompt for this exercise. I started with prepping the paper with water and a light blue sky wash. Next I then added a horizon line with a darker mix of black and ultramarine blue. I tried to give a sense of perspective with the lines on the right and a sense of volume for the trees by loading the paint on the right. I finished by "lifting" paint in the sky to create a cloud. The whole painting was fairly quickly done and yet the result is interesting. Still, I liked the blue-greyish colours and the fluffy trees and bushes created with the wet-on-wet strokes and created a dreamlike scene.

### Experience 4
<!-- /wp:heading -->

I was looking for inspiration to try something different and was flicking through the watercolour ideas book by Joanna Goss. I really liked the mixed media effect, colour combination and composition of the piece "Learning to know 2" by artist Annie Koelle. I tried to see if I could recreate a similar piece. I first created a uniform pale wash in pink and painted shadows for the face in grey. I then drew the face quickly without sketching using a watercolour pencil. It was not proportional at all but I was aiming for a quick result. Still I really enjoyed using a watercolour pencil to draw over the wash, especially to draw the eyes and the nose.

### Experience 5
<!-- /wp:heading -->

I had another go at a variegated wash with watercolour, trying to "stretch" my paper first as a fellow student suggested it could help with the buckling. In the end I think there was too much water... how do I know how much is enough? The same goes for applying brush strokes. I remembered it looked good at some point, and I should have stopped but I didn't. I lost the serendipity. I overworked it.

_Step 1 - Background wash_
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

There is something about my strokes interacting with the paint, the brush, the amount of water and the paper, all at once. I can see how experimenting is very much like learning to drive. This reminded me of Bateson's (1967) "artist's dilemma." The more an artist practice, the better they get at doing what they are attempting to do, and at the same time, the less they are able they are to verbalise what they do as practice makes the skill implicit. Just like in driving, first you have to think about everything at once until you "know" how to do it and you can simply focus on the road to get you where you want to be.

I let the background dry overnight and thought a lot (too much!) about what I could layer over it. I kept imagining a sea with a fish flying off, so I tried this. I'm half happy with the result. It is a pleasing image but I feel it still looks too much like an illustration, rather than an "adult" painting. Possibly because of the line work. In the end I used white watercolour from a tube to go over the white lines in the sea, which I felt improved the texture and the feel a little bit.

## Final reflections
<!-- /wp:heading -->

I think I went a little further than what the instructions asked because I got carried away with the first wash! Still I feel learnt a lot again. Key learnings and reflections include:

<!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I really enjoyed drawing over a variegated wash, especially with bright vibrant watercolour ink and a watercolour pencil.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I do enjoy intuitive painting although the result can be a little random and also a little meaningless (although perhaps not everything piece of art making needs to be meaningful?)
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- All this practice helped me begin to understand how I could play (as well as fail!) with water and paint to create different textures. Less is more seems to be a mantra I need to remember! I like the fluffiness and volume of wet on wet "blooms".
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I love lines but there is a fine line (sic!) between a drawing that works and a cartoonish one. I'm not sure if I need to grow out of lines or better understand when to use them and when not to. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I look forward to developing my skills in painting from life although I also do not want to lose the freshness of an intuitive and colourful approach to art making.
