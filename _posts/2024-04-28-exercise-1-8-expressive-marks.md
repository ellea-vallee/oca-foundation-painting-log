For this exercise, the prompt was to work quickly and expressively with bold gestures using a vase of flowers as a subject.

The prompt was accompanied by a reproduction of Matisse's "Flowers in a pitcher"

_Matisse, Henri (1908). Flowers in a pitcher. Oil on canvas_

I enjoyed this piece from Matisse, the fluid marks and the contrast in values, also in the background. The whole composition "just works" but I am not sure how or why!

For this exercise I had a limited time available. I researched photos of flower arrangements and settled on the picture on the right side from a florist. I chose it for the vibrant colours. After my last two exercises in "toned down" values, I wanted to go back to brighter colours. I love both the softness of the pastels and the boldness of the bright colours, like two sides of the same coin!

Because of the time constraint, I decided to use acrylics instead of oil because it is easier to manage and clean once I am done! I also used a small 5x7 cardboard canvas for the same reasons. I began with a rough sketch of the vase and flowers using a light acrylic pen. Next I used water-down acrylic to block out the background. I used ultramarine blue which is my favourite colour! I discovered this in the practice earlier in the course and I really enjoy the effect as well as the fact that it dries quickly, cannot be diluted once settled but can be covered in layers.

To keep in with the bright colours, I used my tube of fluorescent pink which I mixed with yellow, blue and white to get purples, blues, and oranges. By the end of my first session (pictured on the easel in the gallery above) I had achieved a fairly satisfying outcome, working on showcasing a right source of light like in Matisse's pitcher. This being said, I knew I was not done. I felt the background did not create enough contrast with the colorful flowers and the pot was not "standing out" enough.

I completed this study the next day. I tried to address the issues I had identified. I was fairly happy with the vase and the broad marks. The leaves were challenging but I was trying to keep in line with the constraint of using broad strokes (consoling myself that Matisse had also left out broad strokes on his background!). I could have worked more, but I still have to complete the next exercise today so I decided to stop here for this one.

# Final reflections
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I enjoy working with bright, vivid colours like Matisse's palettes as much as with muted, toned-down colours, like Morandi's palette!
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- My favorite brush is a flat brush!
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I like the final result although I feel it is not completely satisfying, I am not sure what I would need to do next to improve it.
