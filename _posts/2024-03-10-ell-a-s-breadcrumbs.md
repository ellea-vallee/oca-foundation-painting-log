Today I (finally!) completed my first creative challenge for the Induction course, the so-called ["Breadcrumb trail" challenge](https://learn.oca.ac.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=25395&chapterid=6378). In this post I share my reflections on the creative process.

**Spoiler alert!** If you haven't done so, it may be best to follow the trail first before you read on! You can find the trail by clicking the button below or at the end of this post!

I really enjoyed this challenge! At first, when I read the brief, I had no idea of how to tackle this. Settling on a theme to begin was daunting (yes, but how?, what?, so many possibilities...). So I first looked at what other students had done before me for inspiration... and was quickly overwhelmed and back to decision paralysis!

Still seeing that others had done it, motivated me to have a go. So I reverted back to what I was doing right now in relation to art, which was reading a fantastic art history book (yes they exist!). I decided to take this as my starting point and then tried to identify what had struck me about this book, and "follow" this as my breadcrumb trail.

This allowed me to develop a theme around women in art, women as artists, women as artists and activists, onto women's relationships with other women. This was pretty much random associations (pretty much how my mind works as well, ha ha!).

Once I had identified the weblinks, I started to think how I would present the whole breadcrumbs and thought I wanted an engaging visual point of entry. This reminded of an image from one of my favorite films: "Beetlejuice" by Tim Burton. It does feel like joining this foundation course, I'm about to wake up my inner Beetlejuice!

I wanted to make the whole experience fun and easy to get into, so people would want to dive in and check it out. I had my husband test it, and he got stuck right at the beginning because the instructions weren't clear enough. So, I added a few hints to make it easier to understand.

I'm quite pleased with the result and hope it will be fun and/or inspiring for those who visit it. I realised mid-way that feeling part of the OCA community was a great motivation to continue to work on this and finish it! Another reflection was how it was relatively (and surprisingly) easy to find a theme in the end. "Women relationships" is a theme that resonates deeply and for which I could draw on many experiences to explore further as I progress in the course. It taught me to not overthink it at first and follow my instincts. I'll try to hold on to that nugget of wisdom! On the down side, I spent way too long on doing this (it's just a small inducation challenge afterall!). I know this is something I will have to watch out for: sometimes I'm not so good at being strategic with my time management! I have two more challenges to look forward too and will try to set myself a time limit to complete them!
