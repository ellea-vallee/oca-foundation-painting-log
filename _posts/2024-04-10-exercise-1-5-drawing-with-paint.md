## Setting up the stage


For this exercise, I aimed to look at the outlines of a still life made of simple objects, paying attention to where the objects meet the shadows. I tried to make a simple set up but that already took a lot of "faffing about"! Thinking about how do you position the light, the objects, what should they rest on?

_Final set up for my first still life_


Once I was settled, I felt I had so little experience drawing from life, I needed to practice looking before I practiced drawing with paint. I also wanted to practice painting and drawing in larger formats so I used an A3 pad of sketch paper.


## Preparatory sketches


My first pencil sketch was OK for a rough sketch although I found it hard to keep it simple and got caught in too many details, like the reflection of the small white vase on the large dark vase.

Next I tried to focus only on the outlines but I stopped early as I realised the proportions were really off!

In the following sketch, I tried again to aim for better proportions. I noticed how I kept going over the lines but my proportions were still off. The small vase was way too small compared to the big vase!

After that I remembered there is a trick where you hold a stick and try to find a unit mesure which becomes the gold standard against which you measure everything else. I understand the concept but I can "see" it. My hand is too shaky and my eyesight is too blurry! Anyways, I did try to use boxes. It helped a bit but the process was tiresome. Then I started to notice the curve on the vase wasn't quite right and symmetrical...

For my final sketch, I remembered another trick was to use a transparent view finder and draw the outline on it and then use this as a reference. I tried that. Again it did help a little. At last I felt ready to experiment with oil paint!

## Drawing with paint (finally)


For this exercise I decided to try using oil paint. I did try once before a long time ago, and painted a fish. This was just for fun and without any specific goal and skills but I always liked that painting

### Experiment #1


For the first experiment for this exercise, I only used primary phtalo blue as a colour. Unfortunately, I couldn't access the easel when I had time to do this so I painted on a flat surface and used masking tape to secure a small sheet of canvas paper. I tried to stick to the instructions to allow for a fluid line and vary the amount of pressure but I kept going over it. The end result was more of a monochrome study than a drawing with paint although you can notice the line work. I was not sure what brush to use either. Sadly I didn't record which brush I used and I have now forgotten!

The proportions were completely off even though I worked from a photograph.

I can see lots of little mistakes, such as the shadow of the cup which should be a line from the bottom of the cup...



I tried to add more pressure on the lines on the right but I got carried away with getting the forms. I didn't succeed in creating a mix of rigid and gestural marks. This being said I was able to experiment with linseed oil and mix dry and wet marks and the final drawing was not too bad.


### Experiment 2


Although I thoroughly enjoyed working on the first drawing, I felt I had not succeeded in making a drawing with paint. So I tried again, this time from life, and on the easel. I used a larger format and a larger round brush.

The result was pleasing and felt like a drawing with paint this time. I enjoyed the dry marks. I'm not sure I was able to add a lot of variations in terms of the line quality but this felt more like a drawing.


## Final reflections


This was a challenging exercise, which tested my limits and exacerbated my attention to details coupled with a shortage of skills to properly render what I see.



Key learnings and challenges included:


- I need more practice to be able to draw and paint shapes and proportions more accurately.
- I learnt how oil paint can vary between dry and thick or more transparent and fluid marks.
- I was not sure how to choose my brush for the exercise. 
- I enjoyed working from the easel even though I felt I need to exercise my arms and build muscles to sustain the movement as I could feel tension in my shoulder!
- Working from photographs is different than working from real life. I prefer the latter but it's not always easy to have the time and space to set up!
