# The prompt
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this exercise, the prompt was to refer to sketchbook studies from [Exercise 3.3](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/category/coursework/part-3/exercise-3-3-linear-perspective-studies/) and [Exercise 3.4](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/category/coursework/part-3/exercise-3-4-aerial-perspective-study/) to develop a composition further, working from life, the sketchbook study, as well as photographs and make an acrylic or oil painting in a A2 or A3 format.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The added prompt was to focus on developing my understanding of perspective and looking at using different amounts of details and scale while also varying the weight and size of the brush marks to emphasise different areas of the painting.

# The study
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Choosing a subject
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Reviewing my sketchbook studies, there was nothing that I felt connected with. These studies were practice in "making studies" but I did not quite understand what the purpose of a study was. I think I was treating the study as a practice exercise to learn how to use a medium or a technique (like perspective). The idea to "redo" an exercise was not so appealing. I speak in the past because I have since read a book called _[Wayne Thiebaud, Draftstman](https://thamesandhudson.com/wayne-thiebaud-draftsman-9780500021897)_ which presents a study (sic!) of his drawings, published with his cooperation to accompany an [exhibition](https://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/wayne-thiebaud) at the Morgan Library & Museum in New York. A quote with stroke me was:

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote -->

> There is, in my view, a terrific difference in attitude between what are, in effect, called public drawings and private drawings. The difference is primarily one of function. Private drawings are intended "to find out something, to make notations, or just to experiment. You want to feel... that these are things that will never be seen, as opposed to public drawings."
> 
> <!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>Wayne Thiebaud in <em>Wayne Thiebaud, draftsman</em> (p. 110)</cite>

<!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

This made me think that my studies have not been the private experiments or explorations which Thiebaud describes, possibly because I was too conscious that they were ultimately to be shared publicly on this blog.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I was surprised to learn that Thiebaud started as a commercial artist and cartoonist before he turned to painting. His trajectory was fascinating and there are so many aspects that resonated with my own (much more modest) path and helped me understand what attracts me to his artwork. For instance, I have taken courses in graphic design in the past and love fonts, grids, mark-making. I have designed logos, websites, posters, and leaflets many times for many different projects for a variety of businesses. It's only recently that I became interested in academic drawing and painting but my interest in, and love for, design is, I think still core to my practice, and certainly something I would like to explore further (I have now added _[Design as Art](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/19371/design-as-art-by-bruno-munari/9780141035819)_ by Bruno Munari on my reading list to explore this further).

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The book shows how he often drew sketches as thumbnails on the page or focussed on one object or portrait. I thought, I do this all the time on random pieces of papers! I think about these as "private doodles." But I have yet to link the two and practice doodling as an exploration for a painting or public drawing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Back to the exercise, I wanted to paint something for which I felt a connection but also allowed me to practice what I had learnt about perspective, and especially colour perspective which I learnt about during my [research task on Asian art](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/category/uncategorised/research-task-perspective-in-asian-art/) (cooler and bluer tones in the background, warmer and more refined details in the foreground, as in _Les Glaneuses_ of Jean-François Millet). So in the end I chose another holiday snapshot from my summer trip to Carcans, which I took as we were walking towards the sea, hidden by a massive sand dune. I loved the colours in this picture and the composition lines. I also thought this would allow me to practice the colour perspective.

## Under study
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

At first I decided to "eyeball" the composition without guide, just looking at the picture and using an underpainting and a paintbrush drawing. This was done at the end of an oil painting evening class at a local adult college. I thought I could do this to get some live feedback while I was painting. This was a quick 15-minute study at the end of the session as I had finished the painting exercise early. I quite liked it because it was fresh and gestural and not a realistic rendition of the photograph but the class tutor said this was "boring". I was a bit offended (!) and left it aside for a while after that.

_Initial underpainting_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Working my way through
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I quite liked the underpainting but I couldn't completely ignore the feedback so I started to work on it. I did think the burnt umber underpainting made the painting look desaturated and muddy. I was also aware that the perspective lines and the path were only roughly inspired by the picture and the blue of the sky and the yellow of the dune were not the "right" colour.

_Searching for the right shade of blue_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Trying to apply the learning from the pastel drawing in [Exercise 3.4](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/category/coursework/part-3/exercise-3-4-aerial-perspective-study/), I started to work on the sky. I mixed cerulean blue with white, ultramarine blue with white but I was not getting the blue I was looking for. In the end, I used a colour recipe book and figured out the closest was cobalt blue so I mixed it up with titanium to get the shade I was looking for. I also was trying to improve the perspective lines, still trying to eyeball them but I found the dune was too flat.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the end I gave up trying to do this unaided, I reverted to my favorite trick: place a carbon paper behind the photo and trace the main lines over the photo onto the canvas.

_Working on creating perspective through colours_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Once I finally got the angles right, I worked on the fence and tried to use warmer tones at the forefront and cooler tones and less details in the distance. I did the same for the pathway. For the sand dunes, I tried many mixes but I was struggling, again, to "find" the colour I was searching for. It was still too "orange".

_Adding final details_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I got close to the concluding phase in the end. It was fun and surprising to see the figures coming out through tiny brush strokes and highlights, almost magical!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The last problem was the dune which was too uniform and appeared "plasticky". In the end, it was my 10-year old (!) who got me unstuck. She said the dune was grey, not yellow, and I should start with ultramarine and raw umber mixed with white. I was really baffled, and not quite convinced at first but I had no other idea so... I started by mixing a light grey and slowly added yellow ochre, until finally found my dune colour! It was a sweet shared eureka moment and she was very proud to have solved it for me!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The last details I added were a few tiny marks for the trees on the horizon and some branches on the dune. Perhaps it still needs a few more details but I have come a long way and decided to call that larger study "concluded" mostly because I'm now a month late on my personal submission schedule and still have two exercises to complete before I can submit Part 3 for feedback!

_Towards the sea, oil on canvas board, 8 x 10 inches_

The final study is not completely satisfactory but this was a long journey and many iterations to problem-solve issues before I got there, so I decided to call it "concluded"!

# Learning log
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Reflections
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I realised after the fact that I was supposed to work on a larger canvas and somehow forgot about that instruction along the way. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Nevertheless, I felt I learnt a lot from this attempt to implement the colour perspective. For example, the whiter path at the end with the figures works to create the illusion of distance and there is a nice luminosity to the picture (at least I think so?), which captures the brightness of that day as I remember it.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I regretted painting over my initial 15-min study. Without overthinking this, I think I wanted to somehow take the tutor's comment on board even though I disagreed. It's tricky with negative feedback to know what to take and what to leave.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I can't decide if I want to free myself from the photograph and have a more interpretive approach to create my images. I think for now I'm just trying to learn to draw what I see, and deviations are not purposeful. Yet there's something fresher about the first study.

<!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Questions
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- What makes for an interesting composition? In the end, I thought this works because the barrier and the colour perspective are taking us towards in the end of the path and then back up the dune and to the closer edge of the barrier. I got a triangle going, like Matisse (ahem!).
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- It's concluded but not finished. What else could I have done? Or done differently?
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- What else could I have done from the initial underpainting to improve it but keeping with the semi-figurative style?
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- If I want to get live feedback while am I painting, what is the best solution? The lessons from the adult college are not very good, I would like to find a way to get a few live sessions with a practicing artist but I don't know how to choose a tutor or where to find them! Perhaps it's too early...
