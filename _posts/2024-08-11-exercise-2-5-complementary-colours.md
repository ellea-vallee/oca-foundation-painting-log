For this exercise I used only complementary colours.&nbsp;I chose to work with orange and blue.


## Goal setting


The exercise prompted me to try to:


- explore variations within complementaries
- have a looser brush stroke
- simplify shapes
- extend my mark making
- use a variety of brushes


### Setting the scene 


I visited a car boot sale while on holidays in Brittany and collected several objects for still life paintings. My favourite was a blue ceramic ashtray with the word "amourette" ("little love") embossed on it. I looked for an orange object and found a little fluffy deer among my daughter's toys, which I thought would make a fun composition.



I found some instructions for making a light box out of a cardboard box and cut one out for the photo shoot. I still need some semi transparent paper and lights but it was a start.

I tried several arrangements and settled on the deer looking towards the light slightly behind the ashtray.

### Sketching


Next, I decided to work on the background sketch outline to save time to focus on the colour mixing rather than a "life-like" rendering of the photo reference. Still, to scaffold my sketch, I used a polychromous orange pencil and a grid. I set out a template grid in Procreate on my iPad and got to work!

I really liked the typography on the ashtray and while I turned it on its side on purpose, the foreshortening of the word really gave me a hard time!


## Painting and colour mixing


Next, I started to work on the ashtray. I liked the contrast between the soft fur and the shiny ceramic but as I was starting to work on this I realised I was perhaps punching a little bit above my weight (!) because I could see the different shapes and shades of the reflections on the ashtray but they were too detailed and I was trying to squint hard to forget them but it was challenging!

_Early mishaps with the "Amourette" ashtray_


I tried to work with a mix of Ultramarine blue, Cerulean blue and Payne grey to get the reflections and the various shades of blue in. I was not very successful and, sadly, I ruined the sketch of my font which was to be a focal point of the painting. I ended the session at that point because I was getting too upset with myself! On reflection, I now think my paint was too thick and my brush too big: I was using a small filbert with undiluted paint. If I could go back in time, I would block out the word and use diluted paint with a tiny round brush to render the typography.



My next challenge was to mix the orange for the deer. I had the intuition that this was an orange-based colour but I didn't really know how to get to it with mixing... until I had the idea to use the colour wheel in my Procreate app! By using the eye-dropper, I tried to pick a mid-tone and it was a aha! moment. I could see I needed to aim for a bright yellow orange and then tone it down using the Payne grey.

I did use a variety of brushes and was focussing on light and shadows. At the end of a session, I took a break and tried to record a video of where I was and what I was thinking. Sometimes it's hard to just have a conversation with yourself all the time! (Fun fact: In the background, there is an old song French song from the 60s playing which I had playing in my head since I found that ashtray at the boot sale!).

I liked the rough look of the deer but it also looked "blocky" and I chose instead to work on a smoother gradient. I ended up (over?)working the transitions until I got there. I did loose the furry effect in the process but that's for another day!


### Working on the background

_Working on the background_


Once I felt I had enough shadows and shapes, I worked on the background. I was thinking about what colours would complement the blue and orange. I decided to keep to blue tones and go for a light grey for the ground, mixing Payne grey with white and a deep red blue, mixing ultramarine with alizarin crimson for the background. I also used alizarin crimson to paint the antlers.



I felt, however, this was not quite successful. I felt the reddish antlers and the purple background were clashing with the blue of the ashtray which was cooler. Also the nose of the deer was lost in the background. I did like the "fluffy" transition and contrast with the hard ceramic surface. But I felt the background was also a little boring and too unified. I tried to create some texture with a paper towel. The black shadows were also too "blocky". All in all, I was clearly not finished, and the piece was still calling for another session.


### Final stage: reworking the background and final details


For the final stages, I mixed a cooler brown for the antlers, worked on the details including adding a highlight on the nose and I mixed ultramarine with Payne grey for the background, aiming for a darker shade at the bottom and working in some texture, by mixing the paint with diluent and then smoothing it out. I worked on tiny details like the eye and the rims, and the ear. I can still see little imperfections, such as on the top left of the ashtray but I'm letting it go... reminding myself that even the greatest painters left some imperfections in their work. I like to record these, there is something about mistakes that I find interesting...

Above is a painting by Edgar Degas I took when last visiting the National Gallery in April, "Hélène Rouart in her Father's study". I took a close up of the hands: the hand on the left, so delicate and beautiful, the one on the right so... unfinished! Why? What happened there? Somehow the muddled hand is almost more interesting, certainly more intriguing than the perfect one... Something to ponder on at a later stage. Anyways, just as I am writing this, I'm also now realising how Degas used a warm blue and red/orange colour combination for the dress and the chair... It's all slowly falling into place!

## Final thoughts and reflections


In this exercise I tried to:


- explore variations within complementaries, focussing on blue and orange. I discovered that I could use the colour wheel on my iPad Pro to identify the base hue for my colour mixing and also that not all mixed colours go well together (e.g., the warm purple and the cool ultramarine). 
- have a looser brush stroke. I'm not sure what I am seeking there. I like rougher brush marks like in Degas's painting but also appreciate finer details (and the typography!) in work like [William Rochfort](https://www.williamrochfort.com) or [Kate J. Birch](https://katebirchart.com).
- simplify shapes. I suppose I was fairly successful at doing so, especially, for example, on the ashtray with the shadows and reflections or the deer.
- extend my mark making and use a variety of brushes. I feel the piece does not show much mark making although I am extending my approach and I have used a variety of different brushes for this piece. I've enjoyed playing with a mop brush to create "fluffiness" and also trying to use dry brushes to move the wet paint around. As I mentioned before, I also learnt, albeit through an early mistake, that it's not just the brush that count, but it's also the constituency of the paint with the brush (e.g., to get fine details such as the warped typography right).



All in all, I'm still very much enjoying the learning journey and I am starting to see myself pursuing this in the long term beyond the foundation! I do feel I need to progress a little quicker through the course however... So I'm setting myself a challenge to keep it loose for the next exercises in Part 2 so I can progress through them in a few hours, rather than days and weeks! There is also a side of me which longs to be freer and more fluid. I use the left over paint from my last session on an A0 paper. I created this in about 5 minutes. It doesn't qualify as anything other than a scribble but I don't know how to gauge what makes a "successful" fluid piece. Perhaps it is too early for me to go there and I need to stick with the technique and the controlled practice first... or I could challenge myself to do several of these in a row and reflect on what works and what doesn't. I was listening to OCA's artist talk by [Fiona Tracey](https://oca.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=cc78fc38-c0a5-4dc3-8e41-b1b601368de0&start=2694.2743315425755) and the idea of "sitting with an image" and "finding the image" through the process resonated a lot!
