# The prompt
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In this exercise, I explored visual storytelling through photographic collage, focusing on how composition and spatial relationships can create narrative. The prompt asked me to capture a series of photographs from multiple viewpoints of a chosen location, then combine these with found imagery to create four distinct collages. Each piece experiments with different approaches to scale, density, and movement through space, challenging me to consider how the arrangement and overlap of elements affects the viewer's journey through the image. Through this process, I investigated both representational and abstract ways of conveying story through compositional choices.

<!-- /wp:jetpack/tiled-gallery --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I read an [interesting article about Hannah Höch](https://smarthistory.org/hannah-hoch-cut-kitchen-knife-dada-weimar-beer-belly-germany/) and her "Cut with a kitchen knife Dada" collage. The eyes goes everywhere and it's chaotic but the elements are related through opposition and meaning. You can tell that a lot of thought has gone into the selection and arrangements of cultural objects and political figures.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Other artists I looked at included:

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- [John Stezaker](https://www.saatchigallery.com/artist/john_stezaker) with his "Mariages" series of minimalist collages splicing of just two or three images.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- [Martha Rosler](https://www.martharosler.net/house-beautiful) with her commentary on the Vietnam war in her "House Beautiful: Bringing the War Home" series and seamless integration of disparate realities.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- [David Hockney](https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103QT4) with his Pearblossom Highway "joiners" photo collage using multiple viewpoints of the same scene, creating time-based and role-based narrative (from the passenger vs. driver seat)
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I also found a contemporary artist called [Shawn Marshall](https://www.shawnmarshallart.com/collage) by searching for narrative collages on Instagram. I really liked her collage compositions, how she creates structure from lines, harmonious colours, textures, architectures, blocks and text.

_Journey to Kingston Christmas Shopping. 2024. Digital collage._
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Photography
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I chose the pedestrian street in Kingston-upon-Thames. It's always busy and I know it well as I walk through it back and forth in the morning and in the evening on my way to work. It is rich with narrative potential with different people walking through on their way to work, school or whatever they go on about. There are also always people asking for charity donation, playing music, or selling stuff. And there are the shops, the art trail, and people living in the street. I decided to not think too much about composition or the final piece but instead just collecting shots with varying perspectives, with close-ups, wide shots, medium shots of people, objects, and spaces. I walked the street and then back so I could get different angles. The [Giant Galapagos Tortoise](https://lovethelast.com/pages/giant-galapagos-tortoise) and the bronze statue on the lower right are sculptures by Gillie and Marc currently on show in [Kingston's pedestrian street](https://www.kingstonfirst.co.uk/go-wild-in-kingston-this-november-2024/).

## Process
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I couldn't print the photographs straight away and I decided to use my iPad to explore what I could do. I wanted to recreate a 'journey through space' like in Hockney's Pearblossom Highway. I can't say all the decisions were intentional but I was aiming for a divide in the center leading up to the sign and the toirtoise whose gaze would take us to the shoppers with their bags and the various calls to action and finally end with the less saturated but also more serious issues of people experiencing financial insecurities. I wanted to create a contrast between the shoppers and the commercial offers and the people selling, singing, or begging on the streets on the other hand.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Using the iPad allowed me to recreate a vintage look like in Höch's collage contrasting with the bright saturated colours of the consumerist society. It also allowed me to play around with this using the blending modes in Procreate and a 'magazine' look using the half-tone effect.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Seeking feedback
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

It felt a little bit awkward to take pictures of strangers, I was not completely comfortable with it and I felt like I was stealing something without their consent. This was especially the case for pictures of the girls asking for money on the street. Who knows what their stories are? I felt guilty. I should have had cash... I do donate to a women's shelter local association and I care about social injustice. I did not know how to think about this so I asked the Claude LLM. The response gave me food for thought. I need to have some sort of way to make this right when there is a power imbalance.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:verse -->
```
I'm an artist and do collages with snapshots I take on the street. There was a woman sitting down and asking for money. I took a picture and would like to use it in my collage (a narrative on consumerism and societal divide). Is it legal to use the snapshot? Is it morally right?

Last week at the founder's meeting with Diana, she advised us to think in three steps when reviewing a picture: what do you see? what does it mean? how well does it work? I really enjoyed the feedback I got from that. I tried again within our WhatsApp group, encouraging us to think together. I find hearing other people's reactions helps me reflect!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Here are some of the comments I got:

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:verse -->
```
"Sums up the spirit and irony of Chrismas"
"I really sympathise with the juxtaposition of the homeless folk with the headless shoppers. It’s an important theme. But it’s a hard balance between the irony and absurdity of consumer priorities with the quite serious experience of homelessness."
"I see a shopping street where the lights, the tree and the nutcracker suggest Xmas time. Shoppers walk with bags on their heads (?), I am guessing this is aimed as some sort of criticism, which I feel is not very fair, because they seem like ordinary people. Homeless people, buskers and boarded shop fronts suggest this is a place like any big city. The tortoise overlooking all seems a bit misplaced, I can’t tie it to the narrative. My favourite part are the people in the rubbish bin. I like that there are many elements placed together in a pleasing way, maybe a bit too pleasing with the correct perspective and reasonable proportions. I think collage art is useful for shocking and confusing the viewer which I don’t quite feel here."
```
<!-- /wp:verse --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was brilliant to hear these thoughts. They echoed some of my own uneasiness around the juxtaposition of homelessness and consumerism but I think it's OK to create that feeling, it was my intention. This is how I feel when I walk this street, bombarded by ads and calls to action and seeing the girls. Most people walk by with their bags and don't look. Some do give. I am just observing. I'm always a victim of what my colleague behavioural scientists call the "pseudoinefficacy" effect. I can't help thinking of 'all the others' or 'all the other days' and I feel paralysed... so I don't give but I do care. I always make a point to smile if our eye gazes cross each other, to acknowledge them.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was interesting also to see that some reactions were about the girls on the left and others where about the shoppers on the right. It is true that the shopping bags on their head makes them look ridiculous. I didn't mean it in a derogative way, and I agree that ordinary people are also victims of our societal ways of being. I too have "a bag on my head", especially at this time of year.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The tortoise... well the story would be cryptic. But contrary to Geimer's critic of Tuymans<sup data-fn="c2df1917-cd38-4e95-b836-d4009568d91f" class="fn"><a href="#c2df1917-cd38-4e95-b836-d4009568d91f" id="c2df1917-cd38-4e95-b836-d4009568d91f-link">1</a></sup> (or at least what I think I understood from it), I think it sometimes sub-text is inevitable with Art. Art can raise questions and should sometimes requires or encourages the viewer to dig deeper. I wouldn't understand Hannah Höch's picture if I didn't read the sub-text. The (political) narrative will always situated in time. In my case, the tortoise and the pedestrian zone ending is a commentary on the elephant in the room (so to speak), that is the impact of our ways of being on the natural world. But without the reference to Gillie and Marc's sculptures as a subtext, I recognise it is hard to understand.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Concluded piece
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the end, I decided to add a pigeon eying the cake from the second girl hands which allowed me to keep her sad gaze (rather than masking it) while giving her anonymity. I also decided to keep the plastic bags on the shoppers' heads because it was my intention to convey an uneasy feeling rather than a shocking picture. And importantly, the tortoise is still looking!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I had lots of fun working on this!

# Collage #2 - Disrupting expected size relationships

_Women fights. 2024. Paper collage on cardboard._
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Intentions
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In this collage, I was aiming to (try to) disrupt expected size relationships and combine unlikely elements to create visual tension. I used magazine pictures.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I was looking for a narrative while scanning images rather start with a preconceived one. I had two sources: old issues of the New York Review of Books newspaper and Beaux Arts magazines, a prominent French Art magazine. I was struck by the pictures of women in both outlets. They all seemed victims and/or fighters to some degree. I ended up saving a picture of a Palestinian mother who gets to her son's car after it had been blown into pieces, a picture of Mexican mothers demanding what happened to their lost sons, and picture of a Black American woman on the death row, photographed during visiting hours. The women in the Beaux Arts magazine were more affluent and White but not necessarily freer: one was stuck pleading in Barlow's 2015 video game, another was a model stuck inside what looked like a very uncomfortable snake outfit by Thierry Mugler, a renowned French fashion designer in the 80s, and the last one on the top right was a famous artist who looked like she was going to war with her portfolio<sup data-fn="0dd2fde4-ced5-47c7-a8b8-be7819713c7f" class="fn"><a id="0dd2fde4-ced5-47c7-a8b8-be7819713c7f-link" href="#0dd2fde4-ced5-47c7-a8b8-be7819713c7f">2</a></sup>... Of course, nothing comparable in terms of emotional suffering, pointing to the fact that inequalities are not just between men and women, and Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic women's problems are often mundane compared to what women from minority communities go through.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Analysis
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I'm not sure whether the narrative is very legible. When I was playing around with composition I had the idea to interlace the pieces and have cuttings poke through windows and broken walls... But while this is very easy to do digitally, it turned out to be a difficult (and messy!) operation in an analog setting. In the end, I made do with what I could. I tried to use repetition to give rhythm and used a golden card for the background and negative spaces. I tried to "balance" the composition. Perhaps it's not too unbalanced but I feel it's still difficult to read. There is no clear entry into the picture and some aspects of the narrative are not clear, even to myself (e.g., the ruins and the burnt down car vs. the woman modeling in a snake outfit). The difficulty with collage is you cannot have too much of a preconceived idea or else you need to be prepared to search for hours to find the imagery which will fit your narrative. I certaintly don't feel very satisfied with the end result this time but, unlike painting, I can't really do anything about it now that it is glued in. I also find it's still very busy and overwhelming, so for the next collage, I will aim to explore a more minimalist composition and to make better use of the negative space.

## Collage 3: Density vs. Breathing Space

_Choose love. 2024. Collage on Khadi paper._
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Intention
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this collage I wanted to try to experiment with crowded and sparse areas and use negative space intentionally, to affect the story's pacing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Process
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

This seemingly simple collage took me two hours! The narrative constraint was really difficult I realise. I don't feel I have anything interesting to say. Ideas that popped in my head were unnecessarily offensive or sacrilegious and I censured them. I was searching for a story worth telling with the imagery I had, and kept looking for more imagery to find my muse!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I had cut out the text "choose love" and started to assemble the shapes. I don't have a time lapse but there were lots of turning and tossing until the story "emerged". After the heavy and sad collage #2, this was about my wish that the world would get along despite how odd, weird and different we may appear to each other.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Analysis
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I don't think I was very successful at using negative space to convey a story. There is no narrative tension, more of a message.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Aesthetically, I thought the end result was quite balanced. I know it's best not to use the middle line (like photos with a single subject in the middle are 'boring') and we should instead use the grid for points of interest but I like the symmetry in that composition. I also was happy to have kept the elements to a minimum compared to the busy collages #1 and #2.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the final collage, I aim to find a narrative with a story arc to have another go at using the space to convey pace.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Collage 4: Personal Choice
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {"id":1283,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"media"} -->
[![](/{{ site.baseurl }}/images/img-8318-1.jpg)](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5355/2024/12/img_8318-1.jpg)
_As you like it. 2024, collage on paper card._
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Intention
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the fourth collage I decided to explore how to create tension using negative space, balance and juxtaposition. I didn't have a narrative in mind, only cuttings from previous collages which hadn't made it in the final pieces. A Picasso head, a Giacometti bust, a bridge, the word "Unlawful" from a New York Review of Books article...

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Process 
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I moved the cuttings around and the theme of adultery and women's surveilled freedom emerged. I played around with the angles so that Picasso's gaze was looking at Giacometti's sculpture but also the young woman's breasts. The young woman pushing the other woman's head off was a "happy" accident (sic!).

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Analysis 
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I like the mix of order and chaos in this piece. The collage speaks to the different roles that women go through in their lives, how they always seek to be seen and to please, how they are "fun" until they become mothers and boring housewives and how they are always watched and eager to be seen but dethroned by their own daughters or immortalised as idealised fantasies through petrification. The Picasso head is positioned as a godlike sun, his gaze a sun-ray. The Asyut dog symbolises how women remain under surveillance, even beyond petrification.

# Reflections
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I thoroughly enjoyed this exercise!
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- It really allowed me to let go and follow my intuition because you can't have a plan or even a rough idea of what the final piece will look like. The narratives from the last two pieces were really unexpected but also deeply personal. I was surprised!
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I really enjoyed making busy and sparse collages. I feel less is more and the pieces with less images were more digestible, more effective for storytelling and more interesting to look at although I really enjoy all the pieces.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- There's still more I could explore. For example using torn edges and mixing my own photographs with images from magazines 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I enjoyed using the Beaux Arts magazine and the NYRB. I realised the source materials will make a big difference to the end piece. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Issues around rights and anonymity caused me concern. For example, is it OK to use a cut out of Picasso's head? And when it comes to using photographs of people experiencing difficult life situations. This made me think that I would need to be better prepared. Perhaps I could take the picture and then show it to them and ask for their permission to use it, perhaps given them a an artist card with my instagram and information about Voices of Hope (the local association which helps women in need).
