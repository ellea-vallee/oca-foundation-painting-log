## Abstract impressionism and colour field painting


"Abstract Impressionism" refers to a group of US-based leading artists in the 1940s and the 1950s (Dempsey, 2002). They were interested in the fundamentals of painting: form, texture, colour, gesture as a way to express inner emotions and turmoils and the recording of a process. They were animated by the Jungian concept of a "collective unconscious", a search for "universal myths and symbols."



Colour field painting is a style of abstract expressionism that uses unified areas of unmodulated colours. The term was coined by *
*Clement Greenberg*
* in the mid 1960s to distinguish this style from the more gestural, or "painterly" approach of abstract expressionists, with its loose handling of paint, blotted and fused shaped, rhythmic use of colours, and visible layering of marks of brushes, paint knifes or hands to evoke instability. In contrast, colour field painters sought to remove gesture from their paintings, and sought to express "expansiveness, clarity, all-overness" rather than process through the juxtaposition of large areas of colour fused with the surface. Meaning and representation is replaced by "pure, wordless seeing" (Wilkin, 2007).



This new approach was also made possible by the invention of acrylic paint which allowed for pouring directly onto the canvas. They were influenced by Matisse's use of colour, setting raw hues side by side, evoking emotional and visual experiences through adjusting the weights and amounts of colours, and using neutrals judiciously.


## Helen Frankenthaler (1928 - 2011)




Helen Frankenthaler grew up in New York and had "a classic upper-Manhattan upper-middle-class education" (Gopnik, 2021). She is known as the first abstract expressionist to thinned her paints with turpentine and let them soak into a large, unprimed cotton canvas, a practice later called "soak-stained painting technique". She's said to made that decision out of a “combination of impatience, laziness, and innovation” but it is said that by doing so, she "elevated the components of the living mess of life: the runny, the spilled, the spoiled, the vivid—the lipstick-traces-left-on-a-Kleenex part of life." (Gopnik, 2021).



Her education was influenced by Picasso and Cubist painterly syntax, Matisse's juxtaposition of colours, and Jackson Pollock's seemingly spontaneous paintings.

This painting was part of&nbsp;work produced during summers spent in the coastal town of Provincetown showcasing her exploration of the relationship between landscape and abstraction. I liked this painting because it really illustrates the soaking staines and the splashes, as well as the effect created by the justaposition of colours and hues. It is completely non-verbal and yet visually interesting. There is a direction of sorts, a balance, and at the same time, a sense of fluid, unpremeditated movement which gives an aesthetic quality to the mess. I like the contrast.


## Kenneth Noland (1924 - 2010)

Noland first volunteered in the military and spent four years in the Air Force before enrolling in Art School in South Carolina where he was introduced to geometric abstraction and Piet Mondrian's Neo-Placticism and his attempt to express cosmic truths through flat planes of uniform colours. He's also said to have been inspired by Helen Frankenthaler's colour-staining technique.

I chose this piece from Noland to contrast with the fluid stains of Frankenthaler. Here, the vibrant red center create a glowing orb against the outer ring. By alternating the hues and the textures, the effect is hypnotic. I was also intrigued by the mention of [lithography](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/collection-areas/drawings-and-prints/materials-and-techniques/printmaking/lithograph#:~:text=Lithography%20is%20a%20planographic%20printmaking,means%20of%20a%20chemical%20reaction.) and the use of [pulp paper](https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/how-to-make-paper). I am not sure how the lithography was used, but I am guessing, it was used to create the "neater" circle shapes in red and pink hues. This would also mean he would have used a circular frame to create the pulp and paint or ink (?) to give the pulp its different colours.


# Final thoughts

- Although the two artists have been associated with the colour field painting movement, their final pieces are quite different. 
- HF uses paints on raw canvas, KN uses pulp paper and lithography. Neither use a brush or other tool to apply the colour!
- In both pieces, colour has the center stage. There is no apparent trace of historicity but there is a circular rhythm in both pieces. 
- The surface plays a key role in both works. In HF's piece, the raw canvas lets the oil expand around the colour. In KN's piece, the background slate-coloured pulp paper is integral to the effect created by the circles.
- Both pieces convey order and chaos in their own ways. In HF's piece, chaos seems to balance up. The gaze never sets but it stays inside. In KN's piece, the rough edges of the pulp is reminiscent of a burning Sun, constantly moving and yet completely still.
