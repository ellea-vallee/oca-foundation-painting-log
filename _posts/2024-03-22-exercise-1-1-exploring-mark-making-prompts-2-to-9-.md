## #2 Small flat hog, dry brush marks
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

How small is small? For this experiment I used two small flat brushes, a "hog" Da Vinci Maestro 2 size 4 brush and a Daler Rowney Graduate flat shader, also size 4 but made of synthetic bristles. As you can see below they look quite different!

_Two size 4 brushes_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

There is not much I learnt from this other than appreciating the rough texture and the alternate patterns. I find this very calming and therapeutic.

## #3 Small round synthetic with dilute acrylic, long fluid lines
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this experiment I used an "Artecho" brush.

_Small round synthetic Artecho brush (size 0)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I have no idea if this is "artist quality" but the hair was quite bouncy and came back in place so it allowed me a lot of control over the lines. I enjoyed playing with the pressure to create fluid lines that reminded me of water reflections.

## #4 Small flat hog brush with heavy acrylic, long and short marks
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I used the same size 4 hog brush as I did for prompt #2. Not much to say here, just recording for future reference.

## #5 Medium round hog, dots and dabs
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now I do enjoy dots and dabs a lot! I didn't have a medium round hog, only a small one but it was a lot of fun nevertheless!

_Round hog brush size 0_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I played around with small dots with the hog brush and then painted bigger circles with the synthetic round but applying pressure and rotating the brush. There, I also played with diluted layers of circles. Next I returned to the hog to paint dabs, also playing with translucency, rhythm and movement. It's hypnotic, times evaporates when I do this!

## #6 Filbert brush, broken lines
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Another favourite of mine! There are so many ways to interpret broken lines!

_size 8 Artecho filbert I used for this experiment._
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I started with horizontal lines which took me back to the sea and reflecting light effects. Then I tried to add variations with diagonal criss-crossings, moving on to more regular crisscrossing patterns varying colours and finishing off with more curvy, furry lines.

## #7 Palette knife with undiluted acrylic or oil, angular marks

_Size one palette knife_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I have never used a palette knife to apply marks. It was very unpredictable but an interesting jagged effect in the end. I liked the rough texture.

_Artecho fan brush, size 5_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Oh I loved playing with this brush! It felt like holding several brushes at once. I really enjoyed how reactive it was to small variations in lines and how it carried the paint along to create a rough textured effect.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {"id":418,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->

_Mark-making with a fan brush_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I got carried away and used it to make half circle shapes. I love that pattern and the effect looked very aesthetically pleasing, to me at least!

## #9 Wide flat synthetic with fluid acrylic, splatters and drips
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

This was my last experiment, and the messiest! I do like a bit of splatter though. It's therapy against perfectionism. I like the way the splatters suggest movement.

_Splatters and drips_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I didn't have a sponge roller so couldn't complete the layering one colour but will later.
