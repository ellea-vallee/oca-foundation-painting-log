The aim of this exercise was to make a series of six to eight 30-minute composition studies outside in my sketchbook using watercolour, ink or acrylic and asking whether the view was "well balanced" and with "enough elements" to make the study engaging.

## Step 1. Travels
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I have slightly modified this exercise and instead of sitting outside with a sketchbook, I have taken snapshots with my iPhone camera and edited the shots to reflect on the composition. This is something I have done for years now. I quite enjoy it. I tend to "notice" things as a I walk, usually with the family, and snap it. I've never used these photos for anything else other than share a few on social media. This is often very intuitive and I'm not sure how to assess the composition, other than the picture "feeling right".

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I collected shots during our summer vacation in France and edited them on my phone. Then I selected a few as a basis for a quick study in graphite, watercolour and ink. I feel very unsure about what criteria to use to select them, or what to focus on when to approach the task so it's all done rather intuitively.

I feel a little challenged by this exercise. I think I felt more comfortable with symmetrical simple shapes in the still life exercises from the previous project. Here I find the multitude of tones and shades a little overwhelming and the pressure to do a "quick" study adds to the difficulty. This being said, I also like a challenge so I'm pushing myself through it! To help me break down the image, I used an app which overlays a grid over the photograph and I drew the same grid on my paper.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I didn't have the patience or the time to draw the foliage and reverted to a "squiggle" which is a pattern I like to use. I was trying to have variations in value and started with the lines which were what attracted me to the composition in the first instance.

<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Looking at the reference image I can see lots of differences, some of my lines were much more pronounced on the left lower corner and the values are too light although I did try light on the trunks. I'm not sure how to gauge whether this is "engaging" other than the lines somewhat successfully driving up and giving a sense of perspective.

<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this study I set a 10-minute timer to challenge myself to focus on values, forms and lines without worrying about the details. I did extend the time so all in all this probably took me 20 minutes but I was able to capture the essence, somewhat. The composition works possibly because of the foreground vegetation, water in the middle ground and island in the background. Still I find the composition a little unoriginal. I'm not sure how I could have made it more interesting.

<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I used the same approach with the grid. This helped me stay somewhat close to the original composition. I'm not sure whether this is an "engaging" study or what I could do differently to make it more engaging.

_Watercolour on 180 gsm drawing paper (12 x 16 cm)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this study, I decided to use watercolour paint. One morning I noticed a beautiful reflection in the swimming pool of our holiday rental. I only had thin paper available for the study but this made me conscious not to load my brush with too much water. I started with a light pencil drawing to get the shape of the ladder. I also attempted to render the values from the wood and the filter. It's still a little clumsy, especially the metal tubes on the right. Yet I think I like this the most so far. I find the fact that the actual trees are cropped make an interesting paradox which is resolved once the eyes look at the ladder and the reflection.

In terms of the composition, however, I didn't quite manage to stick to the grid. As with the previous studies, this remains approximate and looks "amateurish" but this was a quick study. Perhaps I could revisit this one later on...

## Study 4 - Tree by the lake

_Neocolor ii wax pastels on 180 gsm drawing paper (16 x 12 cm)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For my third study I picked another view of the lake with a tree in the foreground. This was as much an exercise in composition as an experiment with the Caran d'Ache Neocolor ii water-soluble pastels. I enjoyed playing around with them first using them to add values and then using a moist brush to mix the colours on paper. I only tried out a small box set so I was limited with the hues but it was an interesting medium. I liked the effect and textures that the wax pigments created, for example on the tree trunk. As a composition study however I found it to be a little boring and uninspiring but perhaps that's also because the colours didn't quite work together and I was limited by the colours available in the small set—I much preferred the colours of the original photograph!

_Ink drawing on 300 gsm cold-press paper (20 x 14 cm)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this next study I also experimented with new materials and used black Chinese ink, a goat hair brush and an ink pen. I decided to leave the grid aside as the composition was less challenging: it was a road surrounded by the forest at sunset, which we took on the way back from the beach. I really enjoyed the high contrast i could easily create with the medium. The final image is not quite the same as the reference but I didn't mind so much. I was having fun creating contrasts of darker and lighter areas. I know I could have made the white lines a little more in perspective. This is where a grid would have helped.

## Study 6 - Low light shadows 
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this study I picked this snapshot from a walk in Castelnau-de-Médoc in the early sunny morning hours. I spotted this street light and the extended shadow on the vestiges of a plant on the wall. The funny thing is I don't remember snapping that image (I can get in flow mode when I start snapping away!) but looking back at my collection, this one stood out in terms of composition. It's uncanny that I was there when the shadow of the lamp fell exactly on the plant!

_Mixed media study on 300 gsm drawing paper (12 x 16 cm)_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the study, I started with a grid and a very light pencil sketch. Then I used a mix of Indian ink with a brush and a bamboo pen for the values, neocolor pastels for the background (yellow, orange and white) and still finishing touches with the white pastel for the highlights and an acrylic posca pen for the darkest black outlines.

## Reflections and learnings
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I learnt that I was already practicing composition through my "iPhonography" practice which predates the foundation course. Through this exercise I became more reflective of that practice and realised it could provide a rich array of raw materials to inform my paintings.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I often feel I do not know how to approach the task of painting but I realised through this exercise and through the feedback in part 2 that I am already doing what I need to do, like taking the time to draw to study the values before painting. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I've enjoyed experimenting with different materials for these studies. It made me realise that my marks and gestures also depend on the materials I use. I also found that I have more affinity with some materials compared to others. For example, I really liked the high contrast of the pen and ink. I am also (slowly) learning to use watercolour as a sketching material rather than as a basis for painting. I also enjoyed the wax pastels although the colours of the basic set was limiting.
