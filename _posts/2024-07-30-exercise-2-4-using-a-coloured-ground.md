This piece of advice left me with a dilemma. Leaving subject matter aside was surprisingly quite difficult and yet I also understood that I needed to slow down and focus on the process. I've been reading [Art & Fear](https://www.google.fr/books/edition/Art_Fear/6Y51EAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) by David Bayles and Ted Orland and enjoying it a lot. Among many other nuggets of wisdom in this little book, I found a relevant idea for my conundrum: three questions (originally proposed by writer Henry James) to put to my work: <mark style="background-color:#E6E9EC" class="has-inline-color has-darkest-gray-color"><em>What was I trying to achieve? Did I succeed? Was it worth doing?</em> </mark>Bayles and Orland go on to explain the first two questions "_ask you to respond to the work itself, without first pushing it through some aesthetic filter_". They also aptly observe that the third question is "_a zinger_ (...) _that_ _truly opens the universe_" (p. 93-94). That's the one I decided not to worry about for a while! That way, I can set myself interesting goals to achieve and then reflect on whether or not I succeeded, focussing on the process and how I interacted with the materials. As for the universe, I'll put in on hold and assume what I do is worth doing, by default, as part of learning how to use materials successfully!

## Goal setting
<!-- /wp:heading -->

I looked at [Tori Day](https://www.toridayart.co.uk/index.html)'s work and I was really struck by it. One of my favorite pieces was "Kenny". I really like the rough aesthetic, the muted but complementary colours, the shadows (blue on the purple paper, brown on the orange plastic, and green on the back wall). I loved the wood grain of the panel showing through as well as how she let the scene show the set-up for the still life, even painting in the masking tape holding the backdrop paper. I also was taken by the idea of using a Southpark figurine as a subject for the still life. I thought the contrast with the vintage, roughened aesthetic and the modern object as a cultural icon was really compelling.

I find there is something compelling about the life of objects, what they stand for, for good and bad. This made me reflect on what object I could pick as a subject for my still life. I was mulling this over when I came across another little book in our local second-hand bookstore: [History of the world in 100 modern objects](https://www.google.fr/books/edition/History_of_the_World_in_100_Modern_Objec/rE8mEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) by journalist and writer Francesca Hornak. It's a fun read, a bit like an anthropological essay on objects you can find at your local John Lewis store! This was enough to get me going and I decided to pick the first object in the list, the Cambridge Satchel, as my subject.

## Process
<!-- /wp:heading -->

I do own an old satchel which is very similar to, but not quite, a Cambridge satchel. This being said, I am still limited in my home studio to set it up properly. So, instead, I sourced a photograph and proceeded to draw it in pencil to get me started. I enjoyed the symmetry and the curves. I was reflecting on the craftsmanship while I was drawing it and was really taken by the attention to details, up to the perfectly aligned stitches. I tried to pay attention to the shadows and the shapes and used a grid to help me retain the proportions.

_Preparatory study. Graphite pencil on paper. 29.7 x 21 cm_

Next I prepped my canvas. I bought a quality board this time and I started by applying a layer of Sennelier Alizarin Crimson red, planning to let it dry before working on top. I was aiming for a mid tone so I mixed it with... linseed oil. This did not give me a mid-tone at all, only a very shiny bright red (rather obvious in retrospect, but the big mistake meant I certainly learnt my lesson!). Unfortunately, this was so liquid that it ended up dripping down at the bottom and took days to dry. I don't quite know why I ended up there, other than I was doing this when I did not have the required headspace to think about it properly as I was fighting a Covid infection!

When I realised my mistake, I wanted to move forward but then I didn't have a board to work on, so I reverted to using a craft canvas and acrylic paint. My plan, at the time, was to practice the painting with acrylic and explore the difference between painting with acrylic and oil paint. I was tired and impatient (frustrated?) so I decided to edit the photograph of the satchel to turn it black and white, increase the contrast to accentuate the shadows and size it up to an A4. Then I used carbon paper to transfer the shape over on the canvas.

I also didn't quite clean my brushes properly, I didn't use a clean palette, and I ended up with a messy, very uneven first layer... which I rather liked as it reminded me of Tori Day's Kenny! I even used a bit of sandpaper to accentuate the effect. Then I decided to make the background darker and smoother, and used a clean palette and a small brush to work slowly and achieve a precise outline of the satchel.

<!-- /wp:jetpack/tiled-gallery -->

After battling with my Appolonian and Dionysian instincts in the middle of a FLiRT Covid infection, I was stuck. I knew the next stage was the shadows but I didn't know how to get started and then I had a lot of work to catch-up when I was back on my feet. Everyday I saw that satchel and the more I waited, the more I felt paralysed to do something about it.

Finally, we had to pack to go for the summer holidays. We usually spend August in a family holiday home in France. It's in the middle of the countryside but it has lots more space and offered the perfect transition. I packed all my canvases and was finally able to switch my mind back to art-making.

I really liked this quote. It helped me overcome my fear of not getting this right. I knew where I wanted to be, vision was not the issue, but I was dreading the uncertainty of the execution. Instead, I decided to treat this as an experiment. I was working on a £6 canvas, and my aim was clear (create graduated shadows!), all I needed was to embrace uncertainty and make contact with reality.

I felt I had to move on rather than complete an acrylic painting and then start over again with an oil painting as originally planned. I figured acrylic was like a gesso so I could mix the two and apply the oil painting on top of the acrylic ground. I used a small angular nylon brush and decided to experiment with mixing my paint with oil and with a diluent. I was aiming to get a graded shadow using the high contrast black and white photograph as a guide.

_Using an angular 1/8 brush for the shadows_

I used Sennelier Rive Gauche oil paint in raw umber. I'm not sure this is top quality paint. Mostly I got oil out first, without the pigment and then I had to work at it to mix them back together. But once this was done, it was nice and fluid. I started by applying the darkest shadow on the right. Then I tried to mix my paint with oil to create a gradient. It worked relatively well (the middle horizontal shadow) but it was difficult to get a smooth transition. Then I thought I would try mixing paint with the diluent. This did not help me achieve a smooth gradient at all (the shadow by the right buckle)! Instead, it created a rough edge, and added texture through the canvas. It felt I was lifting the paint off, a bit like you can lift moist watercolor with a dry brush. As I was trying, and failing, at creating a smooth gradient with the diluent, I ended up pulling too much of the brown by the right buckle and getting a transparent dark glaze which looked like the bag was dirty. But that mistake turned into an idea: my satchel, rather than looking pristine like in the commercial ad, could look even more roughened up, as a used object that had a life and went to work! So rather than trying to fix that mistake up, I embraced it and applied diluted transparent paint all over the satchel, Dionysos stroke again.

_The Cambridge Satchel, phase 2._

I could have stopped there but I still had the holes below the buckles and the stitches to paint, and I wanted the highlights to be more refined. I also didn't like that the satchel appeared to float. I knew I needed to work on the background.

_the Cambridge Satchel, phase 3_

The next day I continued to work and decided to "place" the satchel on the floor, against a skirting board. I also roughed up the back wall to give it texture and worked on the shadows underneath and the highlights. I mixed alizarin crimson, raw umber and white for the floor and added the stitches. The pink is a slightly less cool pink hue on this photograph, but it is closer to the real colours. It looked more finished but I was struggling with the bottom shadow because the floor was too fresh and I kept muddying them together. The white highlight on the right buckle was also too fuzzy. And the top of the satchel was not rounded enough. I also struggled with the stitches (even though it was quite meditative to paint them!) because I needed to rest my hand to make them with a tiny brush but then I kept staining what I had just done somewhere else... I also chose not to wait until the holes had dried up so the stiches did not look too pristine, although at times it really looked muddy... It was time to stop.

_Practicing the stitch and brush over technique to blend values_

The next day I felt I needed some tutoring to learn how to blend oil. I found a tutorial from thevirtualinstructor.com on blending oil paint with the "stitch method" using a clean filbert brush to pull the different values across the shapes and then a softer nylon brush over the transitions without colour or medium.

[![](/assets/images/photo-2024-07-30-094421-scaled-jpeg)](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5355/2024/07/Photo_2024-07-30_094421-scaled.jpeg)
_Cambridge Satchel, Oil and Acrylic on canvas. 21 x 29.7 cm._

I applied this new knowledge in a couple of additional painting sessions on the Satchel. I was able to blend the light on the floor and also add a soft shadow from the bag on the right side of the back wall. I changed the colour to raw umber mixed with white, finished the stitching, and added a layer of cadmium red deep hue on the back wall.

## Reflections and lessons learnt
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list {"className":"wp-block-list"} -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- Subject matter does not matter, everything is worth doing while I'm learning to interact with materials, tools, and surfaces.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Mixing paint with a bit of medium does not lighten the tone, it only changes the viscosity of the paint.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Mixing oil paint with an oil medium can help somewhat to achieve a smooth gradient while mixing it with diluent can help create a textured gradient. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Blending pigments using the stitch and brush method can create a softer, more delicate gradient.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- This was an experiment so it shows both approaches in one piece but I wouldn't do this in the future. I would choose which approach work best. Here I prefer the blending with oil on the satchel (middle shadow) than the blending with diluant (right shadow). I also like the softer blending on the floor and how it contrasts with the shadow on the bag. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I'm not sure whether I really managed to work "on top of colour" as the exercise intended. I ended up working with only three hues (four if you count the two red hues) and possibly used highlights that were too white. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- The dark tones were very dark. I think this was influenced by using a high contrast photograph but I really like this aesthetic. It reminds me of the wabi-sabi aesthetic of [Leonard Koren](https://leonardkoren.com). 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Working on top of an acrylic background provides an interesting starting point for playing with transparency without having to wait for the oil paint to dry.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I can still see bits I could return to, like making the white a little less bright and white on the left of the buckles and glazing the right side of the satchel with a bit more white, to make it more harmonious although I am not sure how I could do that (white mixed with oil? red and white mixed with diluent?).
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Did I enjoy this? Yes! Did I spent too long on this, absolutely! But I learnt a lot through doing it slowly. It does take me a long time to get into the swing of things and then a long time to get out of it. Transitions and time management remain very challenging. I'm way past my personal deadlines for finishing this on time and I know I will have to start timing myself on the next pieces and establish more of a routine, not just show up when everything else has fallen into place, including my state of mind!
