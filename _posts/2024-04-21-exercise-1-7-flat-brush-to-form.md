## Leg work


The aim of this exercise was to use a small and medium sized flat brush to suggest the shape, form and contours of a still life set up.



In theory, I really like the idea of using flat brush strokes to emphasise form and use "the direction, length and weight" of a mark to describe the planes of an object. I "get the idea" of suggesting three dimensional form without blending the paint but instead only using tone and colour contrasts.

In practice, however, this is another story and I found this exercise quite daunting because even though the result looks quite fluid, I got the feeling each brush stroke had to be quite deliberate whereas (I have come to realise) I am more intuitive when I paint. Perhaps it's who I am, or perhaps it is because I am not an expert (or likely, a bit of both, of course!). I do wish I could be more deliberate and able to use the flat brush to form technique as I really admire Cezanne's work (who doesn't?). I even researched artists for inspiration, and came across [Sarah Spackman](https://www.sarahspackman.com)'s paintings which I found absolutely wonderful, the brush strokes, the lighting, the colour palette. I also looked for tutorials online and an [interesting YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Fh07zQ2KU&t=93s) with tips and advice. Still, when it came to apply the tips or the from a "live" still life, it all seemed rather daunting.

After that, I got sidelined looking for interesting vases with planes and discovered the Japanese [Wabi-Sabi aesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi), the beauty of things imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete. I was absolutely taken by this. This turns out to have been a rediscovery because, I found a photo from in 2022 where I had picked up a reprinted book by Leonard Koren entitled "_Wabi-Sabi for artists, designers, poets and philosophers_". I will definitely return to this later as this is a theme that really speaks to me.


## Setting up to paint


In the end, after much overthinking (aka procrastination!), I missed my self-imposed deadline and had to complete the painting in one setting on a Saturday morning. It was sunny, and my "false Christmas cactus" plant was sitting on the window sill with beautiful highlights. I set out to paint it then and there and began by sketching it using a 6B graphite pencil.

I painted from life rather than the photo and limited my colour palette to the primary colours (ultramarine blue, cadmium red, cadmium yellow) complemented with raw umber and white. I also restricted my use of brushes to flat bristle brushes in different sizes. I now also have solvent and a pot to keep it in, a glass palette for mixing (that is, a cheap cutting board!), and a piece of cotton tissue to wipe the brushes. It still isn't the ideal setting (half on the floor) and I am struggling to make my environment fit my practice but I'm progressing! Perhaps I should register for a live oil painting workshop so I can learn something as basic as how to set up your working environment!

## The painting

[![](/{{ site.baseurl }}/images/photo-2024-02-17-174348.jpeg)](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5355/2024/04/Photo_2024-04-20_131354-scaled.jpg)


I ended up spending probably a couple hours on this painting (so much for working quickly!). I started with mixing the greens but then felt I needed to mix the grays for the background. Only when I was in the midst of it, I realised I was possibly giving myself a challenge too big to bite, trying to paint a white pot against a white window sill!



I worked through by adding layers as I went by. At first the background was much lighter but I felt it didn't contrast enough with the leaves. I was trying to capture the light coming from the window, on the pot, on the sill, on the leaves, on the back wall. I spent so long on this that outside, the sun light rays which got me to choose that subject in the first place had disappeared! I didn't manage to "apply my marks with confidence" as I went over everything many times. This being said, I did enjoy using the flat brushes and changing the angle of the brush to create texture. I also liked how the pot looked in the end and feel at least I somewhat succeeded in allowing brush marks to remain visible.



In terms of weaknesses, I feel the colours of the back window and back wall are a little flat. I could still add a bit of lighter tone closer to the window to show the light coming in. I'm not sure how to approach the blue in the window because this was an executive decision to simplify the background.


## Final reflections


Reflecting back, I feel I learnt quite a bit from this exercise, some of the lessons were quite unexpected.


- When I feel daunted by a task, I can spend a lot of time "pre-crastinating". I know I have to keep the meandering within reasonable limits, both in terms of scope and time spent. But I would like to think it's not time wasted. In this case, I ended up learning a lot from the meandering, even if it was not all related to the exercise at hand (e.g., my "rediscovery" of the Wabi-Sabi aesthetic which I hope to follow-up).
- I really enjoy using a limited palette and flat bristle brushes. I often feel overwhelmed by too much food for thought so constraints and structure help me to focus on a limited key aspects, like form and light. 
- I am drawn to the muted pastel colours of Giorgio Morandi as well as the bright and vibrant colours (like in Sarah Speckman's three lemons painting). There is a bit of a contradiction here but it also resonate with a duality in my own personality! I'm not sure what to make of that yet, just food for thought.
- Despite the logistic challenges of painting from life, I really enjoy painting subjects from life, as opposed to using a photograph. This creates additional difficulties, however, when I am trying to capture fleeting moments, like a ray of sunlight! Perhaps I need to use a mix of both.
