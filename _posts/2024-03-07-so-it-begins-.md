It's a long time coming. In some sense I've been wanted to do this for about 35 years... I've always been dipping in and out, drawing, doodling, painting. I've long been held back by people's opinions ("it's not a job", "it won't pay the rent", "you're not good enough", "you already have a career"...) and my own doubts.

Yet still I was creating logos, comics, taking and editing photos, even made a short film once! About 9 years ago though I was expecting my second child and decided to take a full year break from work. I put together a portfolio of my work (photos, graphic design work, illustrations) and applied for an online graphic design course. To my surprise, I got in! This gave me a boost in confidence (perhaps I was good enough to do this after all...) but I didn't follow through. Family and friends talked me out of it. I don't regret it though. It was not the right time. The choice was between investing in a new artistic career when I had just been promoted or investing in a family house in France. It was a no brainer...

_My first Instagram post ðŸ˜†_

But the fact that I had gotten in was like an itch I couldn't scratch. Then instagram happened. I don't remember how or where but I bought a sketchbook, a few pens, and I started doodling and posting on Instagram. I got a few "likes" from random strangers and it didn't matter that the image was really just a doodle (I mean _really_, just look at that post!). What matters was that it just got me to do another drawing the next day.

And then, something else happened: my daughter, who was then about 2 years old, saw me do this and wanted to join in (of course!). So we started to doodle together. And my oh my, drawing with a two-year old is the best art therapy! I mean the freedom these little beings have to be themselves! I still remember how she'd pick a pen, any pen, make a few marks on a piece of paper, then pick another piece, and draw some more. While I was agonizing about whether my circle was really not a circle on my 5 inch sketchbook, she'd had gone through about 50 doodles and the floor was covered in printer paper!

There is more to that story to get to where I am at today but the point here is that it does not matter how we begin, or when we begin. It really begins when we start ignoring the nay sayers and put ourselves out there. For a long time I believed it was getting that letter of admission that gave me the confidence to start practicing again, but I no longer think it was. I think, instead the key turning point was when I decided to put together a portfolio and submit it. It's too bad that all these years I was crippled by other people's opinions of whether "I was good enough" or "it was a reasonable thing to do". Now I think it does not matter. It's not about whether you are good at it or whether it's reasonable to do it, it's about giving ourselves the freedom to do it, again and again, and let ourselves grow in skills and confidence in the process.
