## The prompt
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this exercise I looked at close-up elements of the landscape, focussing on positive and negative spaces. The prompt was to look at a different section for each study and the relationships between shapes (e.g., spiky vs. rounded), as well as the shadows and different textures and think about the viewpoint to provide the most "dynamic" or "well-balanced" composition. We were also encouraged to start with pencil sketches to explore different ideas before settling on two large one-hour studies on canvases.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Preparatory work
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I took several photographs outside focussing on trees and branches to take me a little outside my comfort zone (i.e., designed objects). I'm reading a book called "_Ways of being_" by James Bridle. In Chapter 2, he discusses how trees are interconnected with all living things from corals to salmon, bears and fungi. I feel the tension between the handmade or manufactured and the naturally occurring. I grew up on the seventh floor of an apartment building so I have long been disconnected from nature. Yet I also believe we need to change our "ways of being" and realign them with nature.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I was reflecting on my studies so far and the fact that my boards have different sizes and ratio of width to heigh but what I used was never a thoughtful decision (apart from choosing square frames in the [previous exercise](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/category/coursework/part-3/exercise-3-6-negative-space/)). I decided to plan my composition for a 14" x 18" canvas (7:9 ratio). I then created a template on Adobe Express, so I could play around with my photographs, rotate and crop until I found an interesting composition.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I felt I still found it difficult to make conscious decisions about composition. I can look at a photo and zoom in and out, rotate until I find it pleasant to look at, but I cannot explain why. The only deliberate decision is to have a look at the rule of thirds and aim to place something interesting at the intersections. To attempt to address this, I searched the library and stumbled upon Arthur Dows' (1912) [Composition](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45410) book. I picked up a few concepts from this: Composition can be simplified as a matter of 1) lines, 2) "notan" or a harmony of black and white areas, and 3) colours. Then, there are five approaches to creating harmony: opposition, transition, subordination, repetition and symmetry.

## Background research
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I thought I would explore the relationship between natural forms and urban manufactured elements. I find the way nature keeps bursting back in fascinating. We, as a species, spend so much time and energy trying to control it and yet it still comes back (I'm thinking about the "weeds" through the tiles on our terrace right now! I'm using quotations marks because my cousin, who was once trained as a botanist, always corrects me "there are no weeds", he always says, "only plants").

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I looked at [Fleur Patrick](https://fleurpatrick.com/work/)'s work and also [David Hockney](https://www.hockney.com/works/paintings/00s)'s Urban Landscapes. They are both very different in line, harmony, and colour (and technique) but I find in both cases they are well balanced. I am guessing I am attracted to the lines in both. Patrick's painting is so delicate and dreamy, that really resonates with me. Hockney's is more vivid, almost aggressive. In both cases I like how the structure is suggested in the background.

## Looking for a subject
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I found it hard to decide on what I wanted to paint. I need the ideas to sink in so I reviewed past snapshots and kept snapping while I was thinking about this and kept looking outside for interesting subjects.

<!-- /wp:jetpack/tiled-gallery --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the end I settled for a snapshot I had taken while walking back from the office. It was a light crispy day and the autumn leaves were looking lovely against the blue sky and the red bricks of the building. It was not my favourite shot necessarily, but one I felt I could work from within the time I had.

## Sketchbook studies
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Next I worked on sketches using Chinese black ink and brushes. I enjoy playing around with the photo, cropping it, rotating it, and distorting it to move lines around.

## First oil study
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {"id":1226,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"media"} -->
[![](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5355/2024/12/IMG_8027.jpeg)](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5355/2024/12/IMG_8027.jpeg)
_Look up! Oil on canvas board. 18 x 14 inch._
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the first study I chose the picture of the leaves and the building with the window on the right. I cropped it so that it was filling a third vertical. I wanted to convey the position of the viewer looking up under the leaves. I'm quite short (5'2!) so I often look up but you see wonderful things when you do!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

My intention was to create an image inspired by the technique used by Fleur, following a quote on her website:

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote -->

> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
> 
> She starts each painting on panel by tracing an outline using a pencil and ruler. In order for this bottom layer to function as an image, rather than a more comprehensive representation, it is important that she is not too familiar with the space that she is drawing; otherwise, she says, the artwork will become “overly descriptive.” She then uses Liquin, a medium that increases the transparency of oil paint and allows it to flow more easily across a substrate, to create translucent layers of colour over the top of the drawn structure. She applies and removes paint with a brush, cloth or pipette.&nbsp;
>

<!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I started with a very diluted background and then applied a thin tape thinking about how the lines could convey perspective. My intention was to create a negative effect where the lines of the cement of the brick work would look lighter than the bricks. Then I tried to mix red and brown for the brick wall with Liquin.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

It didn't quite work out! In hindsight, I mixed too much paint with the liquin and it was too thick. I find it hard to "keep all my intentions in my head" when I start painting and I tend to "go with the flow" once I start. This being said, I can feel I am getting less clueless with all this practice.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I struggled a bit with this study. The paint bled under the tape and the perspective lines didn't quite work. I am also starting to feel pressured by time (I feel I have said this all along!) so I wanted this to be a study, not a concluded painting.

_Process reel for "Look up"_
<!-- /wp:embed --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Time pressure didn't mean I didn't get distracted of course! I am trying to teach myself video editing(!) with instagram reels, and I ended up spending hours documenting the painting process. I know it's not quite 'artsy' but I don't care so much... I figure I am bagging skills for an unknown future project.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The final piece is still full of little imperfections and accidents but I think the composition work. I wanted to contrast the delicate nature of the leaves about to fall and the vibrant brick work. I guess I ended closer to Hockney than Patrick in spirits. But I feel a little less clueless about composition now, which I guess is the aim of the exercise.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Second study
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {"id":1230,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"media"} -->
[![](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5355/2024/12/IMG_8141.jpeg)](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5355/2024/12/IMG_8141.jpeg)
_Composition study. Oil on canvas board. 18 x 14 inch._
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For the second study, I aimed to focus on sticking to time (because I need to move on...) and experimenting with a different composition and viewpoint. I timed myself and ended up spending over 4 hours on this, from the underpainting through to the final details.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

In terms of the composition, I tried to use the 3 x 3 grid to position the window and the wall. I kept redoing the wall. It's just a study and there was not much I liked about it at first. I wanted to use sgraffito for the bricks but it's quite difficult to make straight lines! I ended up doing and redoing it again but I least I got a good feel for the tools I have to create texture! I also used more than a brush, at time moving paint with a cloth or my finger. The lines are still not where I want them to be (in harmony with the lines of the window) but I decided to let it go. I know I have more than enough work to move on to Part 4!

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {"id":1228,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
![](/{{ site.baseurl }}/images/img-8140.jpeg)
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

If I had more time, I would rework the wall (again) and work on the details of the bricks and the branches, paying attention to the light and shadows. Perhaps I would figure out a way to print a large scale version of my photo and use carbon paper to trace it again. Having a strong drawing foundation helps I think. I also think working on larger surfaces forces me out of the details. I don't find it so satisfying. I now understand how paintings can take 80 hours or more!

# Learning log
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:heading -->
## Reflections
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I have come a long way in Part 3 it seems, from an intuition about composition to a more reflective understanding. The principles in Dow's (1912) book were also really useful in helping me think about this. I will definitely revisit it.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I often feel very critical of my studies but then I revisit them and come to find things I like about them. Sharing them also (e.g., in the Foundation monthly meeting) is a good way to gauge the reactions. I shared the "Look up!" study and was happy to hear the group picked up on my intentions.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I feel I have struggled with Part 3 (It took me 4 months to complete it!). I kept redoing my timeline and in the end I'm finishing this almost two months later than I intended. I am a little bit worried about the deadline looming in but I'm also planning to stick to a rigid schedule (ahem). I have 11 weeks left and 12 exercises to complete so there is no much room for wandering anymore!
