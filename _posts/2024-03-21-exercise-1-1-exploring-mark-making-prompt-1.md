In this exercise I was experimenting with, and reflecting on, the different effects I can create while applying paint.

I have used a combination of Turquoise blue and Prussian blue hue from Liquitex. I do love my bright blues!

It's the first time I've used these tubes even though I have purchased them several months ago!

Keeping in mind the advice from the induction about how presentation matters, I decided to use masking tape to frame my "experiments".

To log my experiences I've followed the prompts from the exercise brief. Prompts help me focus even though I feel I should be "more creative". But without them I find it hard to get started, possibilities are just too endless! Maybe I should start a log of prompts to go back to when I feel stuck... (Ha! As I'm writing this I'm thinking that's perhaps a key insight here, in and by itself!). Anyways, back to the task at hand and the first prompt!


## Prompt #1 • Broad, flat hog brush with dilute acrylic - flat wash


I started by googling what a "hog" brush was. There are so many types and brands, I sometimes find it difficult to find my way around! I learnt that they are brushes with thicker, rougher, hair and are [mainly used for painting with oil.](https://www.gadsbys.co.uk/brushes-for-oil-paints/#:~:text=Hog%20brushes%20are%20one%20of,knife%20straight%20from%20the%20tube.) I'd love to learn about using oil paint but I don't have any oil paint and I don't quite know where to start (what brand? What colours?). I'm more familiar with acrylic paint and already have purchased some good quality paint I need to use so I kept it safe for the moment and went with acrylic.



I also had to research what a "flat wash" was (I know, I know nothing!) and discovered I knew what it was, just not the technical term for it. [This article](https://novacolorpaint.com/blogs/nova-color/6-acrylic-paint-shading-techniques) provided an interesting definition (although I am conscious I need to start using other sources than Google!) and reminded me it's primarily a technique used in Watercolour. [This article](https://www.virtualartacademy.com/watercolor-technique-flat-wash/) provided interesting instructions, although when started implementing them I realised I have to mirror them: I'm left-handed and starting from the upper left corner feels really awkward!



The "flat wash" technique is one I always have trouble with. I just can't seem to manage to make a smooth graduation. I tend to overthink it (how much water at second pass? how much paint?) and overwork it. This trial was no different, although I had never tried to do it with diluted acrylic before. I had only tried with watercolour or with undiluted acrylic paint. I made a few interesting discoveries thanks to that prompt.



For example, because acrylic paint dries so quickly, you can quickly come back on your wash and create nice contrasting colours. With watercolour you have to wait or use a hair dryer or else it spreads everywhere. I'm neither patient enough nor organised enough to do either but I like the contrasting effect in layering. And I _really_ liked the nice and crisp layering effect you can quickly achieve with acrylic paint.

_Layering over a flat wash with varying degrees of diluted acrylic paint_


Then I started to layer lines from top to bottom and realised the top was not dried yet so I got some really nice effects mixing sharp bold lines with fluffy wet lines.

_Accidentally experimenting with wet on dry and wet on wet effects with acrylic paint_


I tried to replicate this somewhere else. It didn't worked as well but I'm guessing it's because I had a wet square rather than bold wet lines layered.

_Intentional wet on wet and wet on dry effect... not so successful!_


Next I tried the wash gradient again with the turquoise colour. I failed again to achieve a smooth gradient but I had another "happy accident" where my brush was not evenly loaded with paint. This created a gradient within each brush stroke and I really liked that effect.

_Another failed smooth flat wash yielded another happy accident with unevenly diluted paint on my brush!_


I challenged myself to recreate it and this time it worked!

_An intentional effect from a happy accident!_


That's it, so much learning and fun just from one single prompt!
