## The prompt
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

This exercise suggested to use **a section of an interior** or such as the corner of a living room or a kitchen with a table and a doorway or **a section of a garden** with a path and perhaps a shed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The aim was to produce four watercolor or ink studies, each including enough converging perspective lines without using a ruler but not too much detail and some simple shapes for the architectural features with a limited monochrome palette.

## Preliminary reflections
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I struggled to get started with this exercise. I have done these exercises in the past, I know I am able to, and I'm quite happy with the outcome but the process is painful! On the one hand, I don't particularly enjoy them as I find they are a little too "mechanical" but on the other hand, I struggled with a "loose interpretation".

## Struggling through “resistance”: Study I
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I don’t know why this exercise is causing me so much trouble but I can’t seem to progress through.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I tried to change my medium and made a study using my iPad and had more fun drawing my fluffy sleepers than the room!

_Interior Study I - Digital drawing_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Looking back at it, it was loose but not very successful in using converging lines and the table blob is obviously off.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

So instead of struggling to do this, I decided to do some research and explore other artists’ work to find inspiration.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Paradoxically, I do love how Matisse’s paintings of interiors and especially how he distorted perspective. I visited the MoMa once and have a print of his [Goldfish and Sculpture](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79117). I love the way he used converging lines to suggest the room, but also breaking all rules of what you would expect to see, with the vase and fish bowl seemingly too large, almost like a collage, compared to the woman body and yet the whole composition still looks so harmonious, now that’s interesting! I am not sure why but I feel the converging lines have something to do with it, as well as the masses and contrasting vibrant colours. The shelf on the wall also appears “squashed” but its presence suggests a wall. I’m fascinated by this painting.

_Henri Matisse, Goldfish and sculpture, 1912, Oil on Canvas._
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

[Apparently](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79117), he was grounding his work in observation but, because of the invention of photography, he said his job was no longer to depict what the world looks like. I’m also aware that he, like Picasso, was extremely good at following the rules before breaking them. His early painting “La liseuse” or “the woman reader” is a case in point. The lighting is amazing on her neck, the book and the sculpture on the sideboard, creating a triangle you can't escape from. It’s messy and busy, and yet somehow not overwhelming but evocative of a sense of calmness, again so much to explore in this interior.

_Henri Matisse, La liseuse, 1895, Oil on board._
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I found an [interesting website](https://arthive.com/genres/interior) that explained that interior painting is sometimes referred to as “chamber art”.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote -->

> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
> 
> In such works, artists show the size, design and function of the room, emphasizing the elements of the era, as well as the national and social affiliation of people. The genre depicts a person’s life through the world of things around him/her. The philosopher Georg Hegel called the interior “a kind of human clothing”.

<!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I found that insight really interesting. It helped me understand my own difficulty around the subject. I don’t find my home is like my clothing, which is what you wear outside for others to see. It’s a safe and very private space. But I am interested in reflecting on our relationship with space and objects. I like the idea of interior as an insight into culture and a record of time.

## Getting sketchy: Study II
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I'm determined to see this through. We have a quiet weekend ahead and my goal is to complete this exercise without worrying about being good enough. Imperfect is good to move along.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Reflecting on interiors and "chamber art" I got a book from charity on interior design. These "show" rooms are looking so beautiful and orderly but they are also liveless and unrealistic, like "instagrams". I was about to work from one of the photographs from the book when I stumbled across the insert of a frame lying on my desk. I thought it was the ultimate fake interior and used this as a prompt.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I decided to give my neocolor watercolour sticks another go.

_Set-up for my second study_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I like their versatile nature. I start by sketching roughly and then I work with water to move the pigments around. It's not as unpredictable as watercolor but not as precise as oil paint. It's a good material to loosen me up a bit.

_Using a colour wheel to help me think through colour schemes_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

This being said, I feel these studies are about observing the reference and as I go back over it, I seem to discover things I didn't see at first. That makes it fun.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Reflecting on the composition, while Matisse's Paintings seem to have a triangle or circle rhythm that keeps you in, this study had no clear focus point. Just a line going across the flower pot, the tea pot and the book on the chair.

_Prompt for Study III_
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- /wp:column -->
<!-- /wp:columns --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For study 3, I explored using a different source. My daughter loves to build houses with Lego and I thought I could use one of her latest as a prompt. I took a picture and then printed it out. The colour scheme was not too good so I created a black and white version of the photo. I decided to keep it loose again and used a charcoal pencil. The result was an average drawing and the perspective lines were, again, a rough approximation.

## Study IV
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

For this last study, I decided to use a photograph from the interior decor book I got. I also wanted to get the perspective lines right so I did a quick transfer of the main lines first.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:columns -->
<!-- wp:column -->
<!-- wp:image {"id":1119,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
![](https://spaces.oca.ac.uk/gaellelog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5355/2024/10/IMG_6795-scaled.jpeg)
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- /wp:column --><!-- wp:column -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I used carbon paper and a stick pen to get the perspective lines. I didn't use a ruler to retain fluidity in the drawing.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Next I used my watercolour pastels but instead of applying the pastel straight on the paper, I used my brush to lift the pigments off the pastel and apply on the picture.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I somehow enjoy the medium more than traditional watercolour, possibly because it's highly pigmented.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- /wp:column -->
<!-- /wp:columns --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I tried to pay attention to the colour scheme and how to mix the colours to get the hues in the original picture. I was not completely successful (I think the left wall should have a bit more red in it). But at least, the perspective lines were more accurate. There are lots of details missing but I stopped as it was getting too "overworked" and the paint was getting "grainy".

## Learning log and reflections
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- Reflecting back on studies II and III, I feel I didn't get the perspective lines exactly (the angle of the wall, the angles of the chair legs). 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- In Study II, I also know the shadows are not quite right on the cover and the legs. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Also, the colour scheme wasn't too harmonious. I think perhaps the pink was the wrong choice. Looking at a colour wheel, I think I should have used the orange as base with a tiny bit of brown and white to get a "salmon" colour. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- In Study III, the lines were really "off" but not in a pleasing way, like in Matisse's compositions! I'm still not able to "eyeball" the perspective lines but at least I see it is off. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- In Study IV, I experimented with a middle ground, using carbon paper rather than measuring and getting a near "perfect" drawing. I found the resulting perspective lines more satisfying to look at. Even if the study itself feels a little "middle of the road", it was perhaps the most satisfying approach for a study.

### Questions
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list {"className":"wp-block-list"} -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- Should I use scaffolding tools for my studies (ie using a ruler or a grid and measuring angles, I can get a better perspective) or should I keep practicing "eyeballing" it (eg just looking and drawing) and hoping I will progress without the tools? Are the tools preventing me to learn? Or should I keep using them until I can let them go? Or should I accept that I will always need them and get on?
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- When I do studies, what should I aim for? It occurred to me—as I was agonising to figure out what the next study prompt could be—that perhaps I needed to settle on one prompt and do multiple studies of that one, perhaps using different angles or mediums rather than changing everything each time. I'm not sure what's the best strategy to help me progress.
