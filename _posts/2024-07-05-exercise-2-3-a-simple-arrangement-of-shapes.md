In this exercise, the aim was to paint simple shapes using flat brushes, using different hues and colour values to describe forms.



I decided to use simple fruits. I knew from my sketchbook studies that seemingly simple objects can have quite complex shapes and I felt that mixing colours from primaries to create values was enough of a challenge.



I also wanted to take my time and I decided to work from a photograph so my reference would always be the same (as opposed to the fruits and light changing through time).


## Setting up the still life

I took a few pictures with my phone to look at arrangements and composition. I was going by instinct and some "rules of thumbs" I have learnt from online tutorials such as "use an odd number". I settled for one photograph but I didn't like the colours so much so I used a photo editing app until I was happy with the colours and contrasts.

## Pencil study


Next I decided to draw the composition before painting it. I'm more comfortable with drawing than painting and I thought it would prepare me better if I focussed on the shapes and values with a pencil first.

I didn't get the shapes exactly right. I know I could do it with a grid and measurements but I was more interested in the shadows and values and trying to create form. This being said, and comparing with the picture now I can definitely see my lime was too big so I made a mental note to pay attention to that in the final painting.


## Prepping my canvas


I decided to use a 9 x 12 inch canvas for this painting. It's funny how I used to feel intimidated by the size of canvas and now feel that anything smaller than A4 is too restricting!



Trying to bring about some learnings from the feedback I received on the first project, I prepped my canvas using a molding paste to make it smoother.

Then I decided to try and have a yellow ochre under painting to see if it could help me see the colours better.



I did this quite quickly one evening after the molding paste had dried. I applied the yellow ochre straight from the tube and stretched it with a hake brush. It was not smooth (!) but I liked the rough texture I got as a result. I had no idea as to whether it would show through the painting but I enjoyed the freedom of experimenting!

## Prepping to paint


It took a few days for the canvas to dry after that but then I was finally ready to paint (gulp!)

I remembered that when I used a graphite pencil for the sketch in the previous exercise it got all muddled with the oil paint so this time I tried a yellow, then a blue watercolour pencil instead.

It was even harder to draw the shapes on canvas than on paper. I'm trying to gauge relationships and angles. At least this time the lime looked smaller than the lemon as it should!

_Picking my primaries_


I wanted to learn more about mixing from primaries. I was referring back to the colour mixing exercise and I knew I didn't want a muted orange, so I picked cadmium red and lemon yellow. Then I chose Prussian blue. I hadn't used it in the previous exercises so I'm not sure why I picked it up. I guess my hunch was that I wanted to be able to mix dark values for the shadows.


## Painting 


How do I start? I tried to go for blocking the middle tones first, so I mixed an orange, a green and went straight for the yellow. Then I added a light grey for the background and white for the ground. I aimed for the strokes to be vertical and go up for the back and follow perspective lines for the ground. I also blocked the grey shadows on the ground and started to use darker values of orange for the satsuma.

_Three citruses (early stages)_


After that I "followed the shadows" and tried to observe the tones and mix them in the palette.



It was helpful to work from the primary colours and think about darkening with blue or burnt umber.

By the end of the session my palette was quite messy and after a while it stopped "thinking", I was just "searching" for values. So much so that it's hard to say how I got where I got once I was "in the flow" of it, but I very much enjoyed it!

_Three citruses (penultimate stage)_


I was happy with the end result although admittedly the three fruits look slightly different. The lime is smooth and almost plastic looking and the lemon is more stylised. I don't mind the contrast. I could go back and make the lemon more realistic but blending the transitions a little more but I feel somehow it may not necessarily make the painting work better.



I shared it at the founders' monthly meeting because I was not sure if I was right to consider it done. The feedback was positive and helpful to make me articulate that in fact I liked the tension between the lemon and the lime. If everything was refined it would somehow be less interesting to look at, whereas now it invites the gaze to bump around while making the lime the center of the show (although I'm probably overthinking this!).



The discussion made me reflect on the idea of "knowing when a painting is finished". I've looked at it again since and I know it's not finished as I can see little details which "bug me" still. For example, the shape of the lemon needed fixing but when I tried, the paint was too fresh and the yellow was transparent. So I let it dry for now but I know I need another session for the final touches. I also want to retouch the base of the lemon as the green shouldn't be there. It got there because it mixed up with the blue I used for the shadow. I think somehow I need some purple in there instead although I'm not certain. Still, I think the painting works as it is so I'm a little worried that I will ruin it if I go back to it. But then again I'm thinking, the good thing with oil is that I can keep going back to it until all the "debugging" is done!


## Final touches 


A week later, I went back to the lemon and added a few touches of yellow tints to remove the green at the bottom and make the top edge less transparent.



The difference is hardly noticeable but I'm more satisfied with the final result now!

## Key learnings

- There is much more than "painting" that goes into a still life, from choosing the subject, setting up the composition, setting up the light. 
- I decided to work from a photograph because it allowed me to focus on the shadows and colours and return to the painting without worrying about decay or changing light. I also enjoy photography and it was fun to use my editing app to edit the contrast and colours of the photo before starting to paint. I think this is something I might explore further (distorting the photographic image before painting it).
- Even though it greatly increases the time needed to complete the exercise, I enjoyed drawing the photo before painting it. I find the pencil drawing quite meditative and it helps me "learn" the composition, the shapes and the tonal values. It makes me feel better prepared to "attack" the canvas!
- I learnt still life artists have a light box set up. I might invest if I want to practice more still life. Or I could try and create one myself. I still feel a little limited with the space I have to work in. 
- While I was very good at time management for the first project, I have not been so successful this time round and I am really lagging behind as work and family commitments have eaten up my practice time. On the positive side, I have read about colour mixing and oil painting techniques and for in work I have been liaising with artists and I am now integrating arts-based participatory methods in a research project I'm leading at work. Perhaps one day I'll be able to bring Gaëlle and Ellëa together as one!
