_Dumas, Marlene. Jule-die Vrou. 1985, oil on canvas, Saatchi Gallery, London, UK._

This piece shows a close up of a woman's face. The skin is painted in bright red and the face seems to melt into a hazy red background. The eyes are crisp and realistic in comparison and look straight at the viewer. The mouth is also well defined, alluring, half opened, with an ambiguous hand—no, wait, is it a male organ!?—next to it.

What did I think of it? I hated it at first! I recognise it is meant as a provocation, perhaps a denunciation of how women are perceived as sexual objects. But I think it creates exactly what it purports to denounce: it reduces a beautiful woman to an object in the bare flesh whose only purpose seems to be the subject of a man's infatuation, what a cliché! She's seemingly skinless, completely alienated, reduced to an enslaved position. Argh! Yet... yet... the more I look at her, the more I see how fascinating she is also. After the first shock, disgust, and anger, I find there is something about her gaze, as if she's calling out for help, asking to be set free or maybe she knows what she's doing, and she's not a victim at all... She's not looking at her partner, she's looking at us. Is it a plea or a dare?

## Reflections
<!-- /wp:heading -->

I enjoyed the exercise. I want to learn more about women artists and I didn't know the works of Marlene Dumas until now. I really do not enjoy the way she portrays women or sexuality in her artworks. Yet after I overcame my initial aversive reaction, I found it interesting to reflect on why I felt that way, rather than shut down and pass! The piece grew on me as I reflected on it. So I guess my first insight is that, as I embark on this course, I should make a point to broaden my horizon and try not to dismiss too readily artworks I don't like. Instead I should take the time to look at them and reflect on what I can learn from them!
