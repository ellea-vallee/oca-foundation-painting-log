This exercice required choosing a composition from Exercise 3.1. This was not an easy fit as I overthink things and don't feel confident in my ability to gauge what makes for a good composition. I tried to use social media to see what feedback I would get. I'm not sure how valid this is but, oddly enough, the two images which received the most interactions were also my two favourite images.

So based on all this, I opted to develop Study 3 "Reflections" as an oil painting. As usual, I feel a little (a lot!) weary to start. I'm using a brown canvas board. I started with a grid (it makes me feel safer!) and realised my sketch was a neat 3 x 4 format but the canvas is 24 x 30 cm so I'm missing 2cm!

_Cropped grid_

I decided to crop my composition on the left, which I think works quite well actually by balancing the third tree with the pool ladder.

_Initial set-up_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I started with a grid and used my watercolour sketch as well as an inkjet printout of the photograph. The printout was really grainy but I liked it. Similar to the Satchel painting, I am enjoying working from a grainy picture. It helps me focus on shadows and contrasts.

_Initial steps_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I began by filling in the dark areas, the dark blue reflection of the rolled up swimming pool cover. I used cerulean blue and mixed a bit of Payne grey for the darker shade.

_Painting the tree reflections_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Next I painted the tree reflections in cerulean blue. I first drew the shapes approximately and applied the paint with a very small brush. It felt a little bit "painting by number" but the shapes of the reflected leaves were calling for this, I suppose.

_Experimenting with leaves_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I was wondering whether it was best to paint the leaves dark first and then paint the white with a spec of cerulean blue around or paint the light background first and add the dark leaves afterwards. So I tried both! The result turned out very different, so order matters! The wet on wet was "fluffier". I preferred the first tree which was more defined and so used this approach for the third tree.

_Completing the reflections_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I continued and somewhat messed up with the blue mix as it felt too dark for the area on the bottom right. It is not quite unified with the fluffy tree on the left. I was not so pleased and left the painting alone for a few days.

_Minor additions_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I picked up the brushes again a few days later but I knew the next step was the gradient of the water and I felt intimidated by the task so I put it away again...

_Filling the pool water_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I finally got the courage to get back to it. I feel the pressure of time. I'm taking way too long to complete this (at least 4 hours so far) and I'm weary that I need to progress so I'm not rushed at the end of the course.

_Pool reflections. Oil on Canvas Board. 24 x 30cm_
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

It was a few days again before I managed to get the courage to finish it off. Of course it was not as bad as I thought. Once I was doing it, it felt quite natural. I was happy that I could render the metal bars. I can tell that I'm getting better at seeing the colours. I enjoy working with a limited palette. I also could use my learning from the Satchel painting to create the shadows (ie I mixed the dark paint with diluant and applied it on the dried layer).

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

I'm quite pleased with the outcome. I think it works in terms of composition even though I'm not too sure how or why. It feels there is enough interesting things to look at. Perhaps I also like it because it's a very distinct memory. I was having breakfast with my cousin during the holiday. This was the pool of the house we had rented and I caught sight of the reflection with the early rising sun and stood out mid sentence to take the snapshot. It really embodies that feeling of a beautiful sunny holiday morning.

## Lessons learnt and reflections
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:list -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->- I'm getting more confident at drawing although I feel I still distort my shapes a little.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I enjoy using grainy pictures as prompts. It helps me focus on shapes and values. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I'm sometimes too scared to mess things up and freeze instead of having a go and end up leaving the practice for too long. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- This being said, when I am stuck, I read about the topic (e.g., [Ian Robert's book on composition](https://www.ianroberts.com/mastering-composition/)) so I guess I'm still learning. One idea that stuck with me from that book was the idea to begin by looking for interesting shapes in contrasting values.
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I learnt that if I want sharp edges against a light background, I'm better off applying the dark paint first and filling the white gaps after. If however I want to create "fluffier" edges, I can proceed in reverse order. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- Although I enjoy spending time to conclude a painting, I also need to be more disciplined to complete the exercises in good time so I can devote enough time to all the exercises. 
<!-- /wp:list-item --><!-- wp:list-item -->- I feel that I'm missing input from a live lesson so I booked myself into an evening oil painting class at my local adult college!
